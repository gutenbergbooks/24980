<p class="title">PREFACE</p>

<p>In the former volume, entitled "William Pitt and
National Revival," I sought to trace the career of
Pitt the Younger up to the year 1791. Until then he
was occupied almost entirely with attempts to repair the
evils arising out of the old order of things. Retrenchment
and Reform were his first watchwords; and though
in the year 1785 he failed in his efforts to renovate the
life of Parliament and to improve the fiscal relations with
Ireland, yet his domestic policy in the main achieved a
surprising success. Scarcely less eminent, though far
less known, were his services in the sphere of diplomacy.
In the year 1783, when he became First Lord of the
Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer, nearly half
of the British Empire was torn away, and the remainder
seemed to be at the mercy of the allied Houses of
Bourbon. France, enjoying the alliance of Spain and
Austria and the diplomatic wooings of Catharine&nbsp;II and
Frederick the Great, gave the law to Europe.</p>

<p>By the year 1790 all had changed. In 1787 Pitt supported
Frederick William&nbsp;II of Prussia in overthrowing
French supremacy in the Dutch Netherlands; and a
year later he framed with those two States an alliance
which not only dictated terms to Austria at the Congress
of Reichenbach but also compelled her to forego her far-reaching
schemes on the lower Danube, and to restore
the <span lang="la">status quo</span> in Central Europe and in her Belgian
provinces. British policy triumphed over that of Spain
in the Nootka Sound dispute of the year 1790, thereby<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
securing for the Empire the coast of what is now British
Columbia; it also saved Sweden from a position of acute
danger; and Pitt cherished the hope of forming a league
of the smaller States, including the Dutch Republic,
Denmark, Sweden, Poland, and, if possible, Turkey,
which, with support from Great Britain and Prussia,
would withstand the almost revolutionary schemes of
the Russian and Austrian Courts.</p>

<p>These larger aims were unattainable. The duplicity
of the Court of Berlin, the triumphs of the Russian arms
on the Danube, and changes in the general diplomatic
situation, enabled Catharine&nbsp;II to foil the efforts of Pitt
in 1791. She worked her will on the Turks and not long
after on the Poles; Sweden came to an understanding
with her; and Prussia, slighting the British alliance, drew
near to the new Hapsburg Sovereign, Leopold&nbsp;II. In
fact, the events of the French Revolution in the year
1791 served to focus attention more and more upon Paris;
and monarchs who had thought of little but the conquest
or partition of weaker States now talked of a crusade to
restore order at Paris, with Gustavus&nbsp;III of Sweden as
the new C&#0339;ur de Lion. This occidentation of diplomacy
became pronounced at the time of the attempted escape
of Louis&nbsp;XVI and Marie Antoinette to the eastern
frontier at Midsummer 1791. Their capture at Varennes
and their ignominious return to Paris are in several respects
the central event of the French Revolution. The
incident aroused both democrats and royalists to a fury
which foredoomed to failure all attempts at compromise
between the old order and the new. The fierceness of
the strife in France incited monarchists in all lands to
importunate demands for the extirpation of "the French
plague"; and hence were set in motion forces which Pitt
vainly strove to curb. War soon broke out in Central
Europe. His endeavours to localize it were fruitless; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
thenceforth his chief task was to bring to an honourable
close a conflict which he had not sought. It is therefore
fitting that this study of the latter, less felicitous, but
equally glorious part of his career should begin with a
survey of the situation in Great Britain and on the Continent
at the time of the incident at Varennes which
opened a new chapter in the history of Europe.</p>

<p>In the present volume I have sought to narrate faithfully
and as fully as is possible the story of the dispute
with France, the chief episodes of the war, and the varied
influences which it exerted upon political developments
in these islands, including the early Radical movement,
the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and other events which
brought about the Union of the British and Irish Parliaments,
the break up of the great national party at Westminster
in 1801, and the collapse of the strength of Pitt
early in the course of the struggle with the concentrated
might of Napoleon.</p>

<p>That mighty drama dwarfs the actors. Even the
French Emperor could not sustain the r&ocirc;le which he
aspired to play, and, failing to discern the signs of the
times, was whirled aside by the forces which he claimed
to control. Is it surprising that Pitt, more slightly endowed
by nature, and beset by the many limitations
which hampered the advisers of George&nbsp;III, should have
sunk beneath burdens such as no other English statesman
has been called upon to bear? The success or failure
of such a career is, however, to be measured by the final
success or failure of his policy; and in this respect, as I
have shown, the victor in the Great War was not
Napoleon but Pitt.</p>

<p>To that high enterprise he consecrated all the powers
of his being. His public life is everything; his private
life, unfortunately, counts for little. The materials for
reconstructing it are meagre. I have been able here and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
there to throw new light on his friendships, difficulties,
trials, and, in particular, on the love episode of the year
1797. But in the main the story of the life of Pitt must
soar high above the club and the <span lang="fr">salon</span> to</p>

<p class="poem">
... the toppling heights of Duty scaled.
</p>

<p>Again I must express my hearty thanks to those who
have generously placed at my disposal new materials of
great value, especially to His Grace the Duke of Portland,
the Earl of Harrowby, Earl Stanhope, E. G. Pretyman,
Esq., M.P., and A. M. Broadley, Esq.; also to the
Rev. William Hunt, D.Litt., and Colonel E. M. Lloyd,
late R.E., for valuable advice tendered during the correction
of the proofs, and to Mr. Hubert Hall of H.M. Public
Record Office for assistance during my researches there.
I am also indebted to Lord Auckland and to Messrs.
Longmans for permission to reproduce the miniature of
the Hon. Miss Eden which appeared in Lord Ashbourne's
"Pitt, Some Chapters of his Life and Times," and to
Mr. and Mrs. Doulton for permission to my daughter
to make the sketch of Bowling Green House, the last
residence of Pitt, which is reproduced near the end of
this volume. In the preface to the former volume I expressed
my acknowledgements to recent works bearing
on this subject; and I need only add that numerous new
letters of George&nbsp;III, Pitt, Grenville, Burke, Canning,
etc., which could only be referred to here, will be published
in a work entitled "Pitt and Napoleon Miscellanies,"
including also essays and notes.</p>

<p>In the midst of a maze of events there may sometimes be
found one which serves as a clue, revealing hidden paths,
connecting ways which seem far apart, and leading to a clear
issue. Such was the attempted flight of Louis&nbsp;XVI and Marie
Antoinette to the eastern frontier of France at midsummer 1791,
which may be termed the central event of the French Revolution,
at least in its first phases. The aim of joining the armed
bands of <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span> and the forces held in readiness by Austria was
so obvious as to dispel the myth of "a patriot King" misled for
a time by evil counsellors. True, the moderates, from sheer alarm,
still sought to save the monarchy, and for a time with surprising
success. But bolder men, possessed both of insight and humour,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>perceived the futility of all such efforts to hold down on the throne
the father of his people lest he should again run away. In this
perception the young Republican party found its genesis and its
inspiration. In truth, the attempted flight of the King was a
death-blow to the moderate party, into which the lamented
leader, Mirabeau, had sought to infuse some of his masterful
energy. Thenceforth, the future belonged either to the Jacobins
or to the out and out royalists.</p>

<p>These last saw the horizon brighten in the East. Louis&nbsp;XVI
being under constraint in Paris, their leaders were the French
Princes, the Comte de Provence (afterwards Louis&nbsp;XVIII) and
the Comte d'Artois (Charles&nbsp;X). Around them at Coblentz
there clustered angry swarms of French nobles, gentlemen, and
orthodox priests, whose zeal was reckoned by the earliness of
the date at which they had "emigrated." For many months the
agents of these <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span> had vainly urged the Chanceries of the
Continent to a royalist crusade against the French rebels; and
it seemed appropriate that Gustavus&nbsp;III of Sweden should be
their only convert. Now of a sudden their demands appeared,
instinct with statecraft; and courtiers everywhere exclaimed
that "the French pest" must be stamped out. In that thought
lay in germ a quarter of a century of war.</p>

<p>Already the Prussian and Austrian Governments had vaguely
discussed the need of a joint intervention in France. In fact this
subject formed one of the pretexts for the missions of the Prussian
envoy, Bischoffswerder, to the Emperor Leopold in February
and June 1791.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> As was shown at the close of the former
volume, "William Pitt and National Revival," neither Court took
the matter seriously, the Eastern Question being then their chief
concern. But the flight to Varennes, which Leopold had helped to
arrange, imposed on him the duty of avenging the ensuing insults
to his sister. He prepared to do so with a degree of caution
highly characteristic of him. He refused to move until he knew
the disposition of the Powers, especially of England. From Padua,
where the news of the capture of Louis at Varennes reached him,
he wrote an autograph letter to George&nbsp;III, dated 6th July, urging
him to join in a general demand for the liberation of the King
and Queen of France. He also invited the monarchs of Europe
to launch a Declaration, that they regarded the cause of Louis
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>as their own, and in the last resort to put down a usurpation of
power which it behoved all Governments to repress.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The reply of George, dated St. James's, 23rd July, bears
the imprint of the cool and cautious personality of Pitt and
Grenville, who in this matter may be counted as one. The King
avowed his sympathy with the French Royal Family and his
interest in the present proposals, but declared that his attitude
must depend on his relations to other Powers. He therefore
cherished the hope that the Emperor would consult the welfare
of the whole of Europe by aiding in the work of pacification
between Austria and Turkey now proceeding at Sistova. So
soon as those negotiations were completed, he would instruct his
Ministers to consider the best means of cementing a union
between the Allies and the Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Leopold must have gnashed his teeth on reading this reply,
which beat him at his own game of <span lang="fr">finesse</span>. He had used the
difficulties of England as a means of escaping from the pledges
plighted at the Conference of Reichenbach in July 1790. Pitt
and Grenville retorted by ironically refusing all help until he fulfilled
those pledges. As we have seen, they succeeded; and the
pacification in the East, as also in Belgium, was the result.</p>

<p>Equally chilling was the conduct of Pitt towards the <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span>.
The French Princes at Coblentz had sent over the former French
Minister, Calonne, "to solicit from His Majesty an assurance of
his neutrality in the event&nbsp;... of an attempt being made by
the Emperor and other Powers in support of the royal party in
France." Pitt and Grenville refused to receive Calonne, and
sent to the Comte d'Artois a letter expressing sympathy with
the situation of the King and Queen of France, but declining
to give any promise as to the line of conduct which the British
Government might pursue.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>No less vague were the terms in which George&nbsp;III replied to
a letter of the King of Sweden. Gustavus had for some little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>time been at Aix-la-Chapelle in the hope of leading a royalist
crusade into France as a sequel to the expected escape of
Louis&nbsp;XVI and Marie Antoinette. As readers of Carlyle will
remember, the Swedish noble, Count Fersen, chivalrously helped
their flight towards Metz; and deep was the chagrin of Gustavus
and his squire on hearing the news from Varennes. They longed
to strike at once. But how could they strike while Leopold,
Catharine, and Frederick William declared that everything must
depend on the action of England? The following significant
sentence in Fersen's diary shows the feeling prevalent at Brussels,
as elsewhere, respecting England: "We must know if that
Power regards the continuation of anarchy in France as more
advantageous than order."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Fersen had imbibed this notion at
Brussels from Count Mercy d'Argenteau, the Austrian Minister,
whose letters often harp on this string. Thus on 7th March
1791 he writes: "The worst obstacles for the King of France will
always come from England, which wishes to prolong the horrors
in France and ruin her." A little later he avers that the only
way to save the French monarchy is by a civil war, "and
England (unless won over) will support the popular party."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In order to win Pitt over to the cause of neutrality from which
he never intended to swerve, Gustavus and Fersen persuaded an
Englishman named Crawford to proceed to London with letters
for George&nbsp;III and Pitt, dated 22nd July.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> To the King he described
the danger to all Governments which must ensue if the
French revolted with impunity. He therefore begged to know
speedily whether His Majesty would accord full liberty "to the
Princes of Germany and to those, who, owing to the long <span class="ins" title="disance">distance</span>,
can only arrive by sea."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Evidently, then, Gustavus feared
lest England might stop the fleet in which he intended to convey
Swedish and Russian troops to the coast of Normandy for a
dash at Paris. The answer of George soothed these fears, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>that of Pitt, dated August 1791, was a model of courtly complaisance.</p>

<p>Compared with the shrewd balancings of the Emperor Leopold
and the cold neutrality of Pitt, the policy of Frederick William&nbsp;II
of Prussia seemed for a time to be instinct with generosity.
Despite the fears of his counsellors that a <span lang="fr">rapprochement</span> to
Austria would involve Prussia in the ruin which the friendship
of the Hapsburgs had brought on France, the King turned
eagerly towards Vienna; and on 25th July Kaunitz and
Bischoffswerder signed a preliminary treaty of alliance mutually
guaranteeing their territories, and agreeing to further the aims of
the Emperor respecting France. Frederick William was on fire
for the royalist crusade. He even assured Baron Rolle, the agent
of the French princes, that something would be done in that
season.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Pitt and Grenville disapproved the action of Prussia
in signing this compact, impairing as it did the validity of the
Anglo-Prussian alliance of the year 1788; but Frederick William
peevishly asserted his right to make what treaties he thought
good, and remarked that he was now quits with England for the
bad turns she had played him.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> On their side, the British Ministers,
by way of marking their disapproval of the warlike
counsels of Berlin and Vienna, decided not to send an envoy to
Pilnitz, the summer abode of the Elector of Saxony, where a conference
was arranged between Leopold and Frederick William.</p>

<p>As is well known, the Comte d'Artois and Calonne now
cherished lofty hopes of decisive action by all the monarchs
against the French rebels. But Leopold, with his usual caution,
repelled alike the solicitations of Artois and the warlike counsels
of Frederick William, the result of their deliberations being the
famous Declaration of Pilnitz (27th August). In it they expressed
the hope that all the sovereigns of Europe</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>will not refuse to employ, in conjunction with their said Majesties,
the most efficient means in proportion to their resources, to place the
King of France in a position to establish with the most absolute freedom,
the foundations of a monarchical form of government, which shall
at once be in harmony with the rights of sovereigns and promote the
welfare of the French nation. In that case [<span lang="fr">alors et dans ce cas</span>] their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>said Majesties, the Emperor and the King of Prussia, are resolved to
act promptly and in common accord with the forces necessary to attain
the desired common end.</p>
</div>


<p>Obviously, the gist of the whole Declaration lay in the words
<span lang="fr">alors et dans ce cas</span>. If they be emphasized, they destroy the
force of the document; for a union of all the monarchs was an
impossibility, it being well known that England would not, and
Sardinia, and Naples (probably also Spain) could not, take up
arms. In fact, on that very evening Leopold wrote to Kaunitz
that he had not in the least committed himself.&mdash;"<span lang="fr">Alors et dans
ce cas</span> is with me the law and the prophets. If England fails us,
the case is non-existent." Further, when the Comte d'Artois,
two days later, urged the Emperor to give effect to the Declaration
by ordering his troops to march westwards, he sent a sharp
retort, asserted that he would not go beyond the Declaration,
and forbade the French Princes to do so.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>To the good sense and insight of Grenville and Pitt, the
Pilnitz Declaration was one of the <span lang="fr">com&eacute;dies augustes</span> of history,
as Mallet du Pan termed it. Grenville saw that Leopold would
stay his hand until England chose to act, meanwhile alleging
her neutrality as an excuse for doing nothing.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Thus, the resolve
of Catharine to give nothing but fair words being already surmised,
the <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span> found to their annoyance that Pitt's passivity
clogged their efforts&mdash;the chief reason why they shrilly upbraided
him for his insular egotism. Certainly his attitude was far from
romantic; but surely, after the sharp lesson which he had received
from the House of Commons in the spring of 1791 during the
dispute with Russia, caution was needful; and he probably discerned
a truth hidden from the <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span>, that an invasion of France
for the rescue of the King and Queen would seal their doom and
increase the welter in that unhappy land.</p>

<p>Pitt and Grenville spent the middle of September at Weymouth
in attendance on George&nbsp;III; and we can imagine their
satisfaction at the prospect of universal peace and prosperity.
Pitt consoled himself for the not very creditable end to the
Russian negotiation by reflecting that our revenue was steadily
rising. "We are already &pound;178,000 gainers in this quarter," he
wrote to George Rose on 10th August.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In fact, the cyclonic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>disturbances of the past few years now gave place to a lull.
The Russo-Turkish War had virtually ended; Catharine and
Gustavus were on friendly terms; the ferment in the Hapsburg
dominions had died down, except in Brabant; the Poles were
working their new constitution well; and, but for Jacobin propaganda
in Italy and the Rhineland, the outlook was serene.</p>

<p>At this time, too, there seemed a chance of a reconciliation
between Louis&nbsp;XVI and his people. On 14th September he
accepted the new democratic constitution, a step which filled
France with rejoicing and furnished the desired excuse for Leopold
to remain passive. Kaunitz, who had consistently opposed
intervention in France, now asserted that Louis had voluntarily
accepted the constitution. The action of Louis and Marie
Antoinette was in reality forced. Amidst the Queen's expressions
of contempt for the French Princes at Coblentz, the suppressed
fire of her fury against her captors flashes forth in this
sentence written to Mercy d'Argenteau (28th August)&mdash;"The
only question for us is to lull them to sleep and inspire them
with confidence so as to trick them the better afterwards."&mdash;And
again (12th September)&mdash;"My God! Must I, with this blood
in my veins, pass my days among such beings as these, and in
such an age as this?" Leopold must have known her real feelings;
but he chose to abide by the official language of Louis, and to
advise the Powers to accept the new situation.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>This peaceful turn of affairs sorely troubled the French
Princes and Burke. In August and September 1791 his son
Richard was at Coblentz, and informed his father of the consternation
of the <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span> on hearing that the Emperor declined
to draw the sword. Burke himself was equally agitated, and on
or about 24th September had a long interview with Pitt and
Grenville, at the house of the latter. We gather from Burke's
"Letters on the Conduct of our Domestic Parties," that it was
the first time he had met Pitt in private; and the meeting must
have been somewhat awkward. After dining, with Grenville as
host, the three men conferred together till eleven o'clock, discussing
the whole situation "very calmly" (says Burke); but
we can fancy the tumult of feelings in the breast of the old man
when he found both Ministers firm as adamant against intervention
in France. "They are certainly right as to their general
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>inclinations," he wrote to his son, "perfectly so, I have not a
shadow of doubt; but at the same time they are cold and dead
as to any attempt whatsoever to give them effect." The heat of
the Irish royalist failed to kindle a spark of feeling in the two
cousins. He found that their "deadness" proceeded from a
rooted distrust of the Emperor Leopold, and from a conviction
that Britain had nothing to fear from Jacobinical propaganda.
Above all they believed that the present was not the time for
action, especially as the imminence of bankruptcy in France
would discredit the new Legislative Assembly, and render an
invasion easier in the near future.</p>

<p>Are we to infer from this that Pitt and his cousin looked
forward to a time when the monarchs could invade France with
safety? Such an inference would be rash. It is more probable
that they here found an excuse for postponing their decision
and a means of calming an insistent visitor. Certainly they impressed
Burke with a belief in their sincere but secret sympathy
with the royalist cause. The three men also agreed in suspecting
Leopold, though Burke tried to prove that his treachery was not
premeditated, but sprang from "some complexional inconstancy."
Pitt and Grenville, knowing the doggedness with which the
Emperor pushed towards his goal, amidst many a shift and turn,
evidently were not convinced.</p>

<p>At this time they had special reasons for distrusting Leopold
and his advisers. The Austrian Government had received a
letter, dated Dresden, 27th August (the day of the Declaration
of Pilnitz), stating that England promised to remain neutral
only on condition that the Emperor would not withdraw any
troops from his Belgic lands, as they were needed to uphold the
arrangements of which she was a guarantee. This extraordinary
statement grew out of a remark of Grenville to the Austrian
Ambassador in London, that, in view of the unrest in the
Netherlands, it might be well not to leave them without troops.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
The mis-statement was not only accepted at Vienna, but was
forwarded to various Courts, the final version being that England
might attack Austria if she withdrew her troops from Flanders,
and that therefore Leopold could not draw the sword against
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>France until his army on the Turkish borders arrived in Swabia.
Some were found who believed this odd <span lang="la">farrago</span>; but those who
watched the calculating balance of Hapsburg policy saw in it
one more excuse for a masterly inactivity.</p>

<p>Still less were our Ministers inclined to unite with Catharine in
the universal royalist league then under discussion at St. Petersburg.
The Czarina having charged her ambassador, Vorontzoff,
to find out the sentiments of Pitt and Grenville on this subject,
he replied that England would persevere in the strict neutrality
which she had all along observed, "and that, with respect to the
measures of active intervention which other Powers might have
in contemplation, it was His Majesty's determination not to
take any part either in supporting or in opposing them." Now
Russia, like Austria and Spain, had decided not to act unless
England joined the concert;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and this waiting on the action of
a Power which had already declared its resolve to do nothing
enables us to test the sincerity of the continental monarchs.
As for the Czarina, her royalist fervour expended itself in deposing
the busts of democrats, in ordering the French Minister to
remain away from Court, and in condemning any Russian who
had dealings with him to be publicly flogged. Moreover, while
thus drilling her own subjects, the quondam friend of Diderot
kept her eyes fixed upon Warsaw. The shrewdest diplomatist
of the age had already divined her aims, which he thus trenchantly
summed up: "The Empress only waits to see Austria
and Prussia committed in France, to overturn everything in
Poland."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Kaunitz lived on to see his cynical prophecy fulfilled
to the letter.</p>

<hr />

<p>The reader will have noticed with some surprise the statement
of Burke that Pitt and Grenville had not the slightest fear of the
spread of French principles in England. As we know, Burke
vehemently maintained the contrary, averring that the French
plague, unless crushed at Paris, would infect the world. In his
survey of the European States he admitted that we were less
liable to infection than Germany, Holland, and Italy, owing to
the excellence of our constitution; but he feared that our nearness
to France, and our zeal for liberty, would expose us to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>some danger. Why he should have cherished these fears is hard
to say; for to him the French Revolution was "a wild attempt
to methodize anarchy," "a foul, impious, monstrous thing, wholly
out of the course of moral nature."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Surely if British and
French principles were so utterly different, we were in no more
danger of infection from the Jacobins than of catching swine
fever.</p>

<p>This was virtually the view of Pitt and Grenville; for there were
no premonitory symptoms of infection, but much the reverse.
Londoners showed the utmost joy at the first news of the
escape of the King and Queen from Paris, and were equally
depressed by the news from Varennes. As we shall presently
see, it was with shouts of "Long live the King," "Church and
State," "Down with the Dissenters," "No Olivers," "Down with
the Rump," "No false Rights of Man," that the rabble of
Birmingham wrecked and burnt the houses of Dr. Priestley and
other prominent Nonconformists of that town. Only by slow
degrees did this loyal enthusiasm give place to opinions which
in course of time came to be called Radical. It may be well to
trace briefly the fluctuations of public opinion, to which the
career of Pitt stands in vital relation.</p>

<p>The growth of discontent in Great Britain may be ascribed to
definite evils in the body politic, and it seems to have arisen
only secondarily from French propaganda. The first question
which kindled the fire of resentment was that of the civic and
political disabilities still imposed on Nonconformists by the
Corporation and Test Acts of the reign of Charles&nbsp;II. Pitt's
decision in the session of 1787 to uphold those Acts ensured the
rejection of Beaufoy's motion for their repeal of 176 votes to 98;
but undeterred by his defeat, Beaufoy brought the matter before
the House on 8th May 1789, and, despite the opposition of Pitt,
secured 102 votes against 122. The Prime Minister's chief argument
was that if Dissenters were admitted to civic rights they
might use their power to overthrow the Church Establishment.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Clearly the opinion of the House was drifting away from him on
that question; and it is a proof of his growing indifference to
questions of Reform that now, four days after the assembly of the
States-General of France at Versailles, he should have held to
views so repugnant to the spirit of the age.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>
<p>Thenceforth that question could not be debated solely on its
own merits. The attacks made by the French National Assembly
on the Church of France, particularly the confiscation of
its tithes and landed property, soon aroused heated feelings in
this country, though on a subject of a wholly different kind.
The result was that, while Dissenters peacefully agitated for
permission to act as citizens, they were represented as endeavouring
to despoil the Church, after the fashion of Talleyrand
and Mirabeau. A work by a Manchester merchant, Thomas
Walker, reveals the influence of this question on the political
activities of the time. The Nonconformists of that town and
county hoped to gain a majority in next session or in the following
Parliament, while the High Churchmen, to the cry of
"The Church in Danger," declared the two Acts of Charles&nbsp;II to
be the bulwarks of the constitution.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> This cry was everywhere
taken up, with the result that in the Parliament elected in 1790
the Tories gained ground. Consequently, even the able advocacy
of Fox on behalf of religious liberty failed to save Beaufoy's
motion from a crushing defeat. Pitt spoke against the proposal
and carried the House with him by 294 votes to 105. This vote
illustrates the baleful influence exerted by the French Revolution
on the cause of Reform in these islands.</p>

<p>A second example soon occurred. Only three days later
Flood brought forward a motion for Parliamentary Reform
which the wildest of alarmists could not call revolutionary. He
proposed to add to the House of Commons one hundred members,
elected by the resident householders of the counties, those
areas being far less corrupt than the towns; and he suggested
that, if the total number of members were deemed excessive,
fifty seats in the smallest boroughs might be declared vacant.
This proposal differed but little from that of Pitt in the session
of 1785, which aimed at disfranchising thirty-six decayed boroughs
and apportioning their seventy-two members to the larger
counties, as also to London and Westminster. In a speech
which might have been made by Pitt in pre-Revolution times
Flood declared that the events in France showed the need of a
timely repair of outworn institutions.</p>

<p>This was as a red rag to Windham, a prominent recruit from
the Whigs, who now used all the artifices of rhetoric to terrify his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>hearers. He besought them in turn not to repair their house in
the hurricane season, not to imitate the valetudinarian of the
"Spectator," who read medical books until he discovered he had
every symptom of the gout except the pain. These fallacious
similes captivated the squires; and Pitt himself complimented
the orator on his ingenious arguments. For himself, he declared
his desire of Reform to be as zealous as ever; but he
"could see no utility in any gentleman's bringing forward such
a motion as the present at that moment," and feared that the
cause might thereby suffer disgrace and lose ground. Fox, on
the other hand, ridiculed all thought of panic on account of
the French Revolution, but he admitted that the majority both
in Parliament and the nation did not want Reform. Grenville,
Wilberforce, and Burke opposed the motion, while even Duncombe
declined to vote for it at present. It was accordingly

<p>Disappointment at the course of these debates served to band
Nonconformists and reformers in a close alliance. Hitherto they
had alike supported Pitt and the royal prerogative, especially at
the time of the Regency struggle. In May 1789, when Pitt
opposed the Nonconformist claims, Dr. Priestley wrote that
Fox would regain his popularity with Dissenters, while Pitt
would lose ground.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Now, when the doors of the franchise and
of civic privilege were fast barred, resentment and indignation
began to arouse the groups of the unprivileged left outside.
The news that Frenchmen had framed a Departmental System,
in which all privileges had vanished, and all men were citizens,
with equal rights in the making of laws and local regulations,
worked potently in England, furthering the growth of an institution
little known in this country, the political club. As the
Jacobins had adapted the English idea of a club to political
uses, so now the early Radicals re-adapted it to English needs.
"The Manchester Constitutional Society"<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> was founded by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>Walker and others in October 1790, in order to oppose a
"Church and King Club," which High Churchmen had started
in March, after the news of the triumph of their principles in
Parliament. The Manchester reformers struck the key-note of
the coming age by asserting in their programme that in every
community the authority of the governors must be derived
from the consent of the governed, and that the welfare of the
people was the true aim of Government. They further declared
that honours and rewards were due only for services rendered
to the State; that all officials, without exception, were responsible
to the people; that "actions only, not opinions, are the
proper objects of civil jurisdictions"; that no law is fairly made
except by a majority of the people; and that the people of
Great Britain were not fully and fairly represented in Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The Church and King Club, on the contrary, reprobated all
change in "one of the most beautiful systems of government
that the combined efforts of human wisdom has [<span lang="la">sic</span>] ever yet
been able to accomplish." The issue between the two parties
was thus sharply outlined. The Tories of Manchester gloried
in a state of things which shut out about half of their fellow-citizens
from civic rights and their whole community from any
direct share in the making of laws. In their eyes the Church
and the monarchy were in danger if Nonconformists became
citizens, and if a score of Cornish villages yielded up their legislative
powers to Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, and other hives
of industry.</p>

<p>Scotland also began to awake. The torpor of that keen and
intellectual people, under a system of misrepresentation which
assigned to them forty-five members and forty-four to Cornwall,
is incomprehensible, unless we may ascribe it to the waning of
all enthusiasm after the "forty-five" and to the supremacy of
material interests so characteristic of the age. In any case, this
political apathy was now to end; and here, too, as in the case
of England, Government applied the spur.</p>

<p>On 10th May 1791 Sir Gilbert Elliot (afterwards Earl of
Minto) brought forward a motion in Parliament for the repeal
of the Test Act, so far as it concerned Scotland. He voiced a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>petition of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and
declared that the Presbyterians felt the grievance of being excluded
from civic offices unless they perverted. On wider grounds
also he appealed against this petty form of persecution, which
might make men hypocrites but never sincere converts. Henry
Dundas and his nephew, Robert Dundas (Lord Advocate for
Scotland), opposed the motion, mainly because it would infringe
the terms of the Act of Union; but Henry added the
curious argument that, if Scottish Presbyterians were relieved
from the Test Act, then the English Dissenters would have
been "unjustly, harshly, and cruelly used." Pitt avowed himself
"not a violent friend, but a firm and steady friend" of the Test
Act, as being essential to the security of the Church and therefore
of the civil establishment of the country. Accordingly,
Elliot's motion was defeated by 149 votes to 62.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> It is curious
that, a month earlier, the House had agreed to a Bill granting
slightly wider toleration to "Catholic Dissenters."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>While Pitt was thus strengthening the old buttresses of Church
and State, the son of a Quaker had subjected the whole fabric
to a battery of violent rhetoric. It is scarcely too much to call
Thomas Paine the Rousseau of English democracy. For, if his
arguments lacked the novelty of those of the Genevese thinker (and
even they were far from original), they equalled them in effectiveness,
and excelled them in practicability. "The Rights of Man"
(Part&nbsp;I) may be termed an insular version of the "Contrat Social,"
with this difference, that the English writer pointed the way to
changes which were far from visionary, while the Genevese seer
outlined a polity fit only for a Swiss canton peopled by philosophers.
Paine had had the advantage of close contact with
men and affairs in both hemispheres. Not even Cobbett, his
literary successor, passed through more varied experiences. Born
in 1737 at Thetford in Norfolk, Paine divided his early life between
stay-making, excise work, the vending of tobacco, and a
seafaring life. His keen eyes, lofty brow, prominent nose, proclaimed
him a thinker and fighter, and therefore, in that age, a
rebel. What more natural than that he, a foe to authority and
hater of oppression, should go to America to help on the cause
of Washington? There at last he discovered his true vocation.
His broadsides struck home. "Rebellious staymaker, unkempt,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>says Carlyle, "who feels that he, a single needleman, did by his
'Common Sense' pamphlet, free America; that he can, and will
free all this world; perhaps even the other." Tom Paine, indeed,
had the rare gift of voicing tersely and stridently the dumb desires
of the masses. Further, a sojourn in France before and
during the early part of the Revolution enabled him to frame a
crushing retort to Burke's "Reflections." The result was Part&nbsp;I
of the "Rights of Man," which he flung off at the "Angel" in
Islington in February 1791.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The general aims of the pamphlet are now as little open to
question as the famous Declaration which he sought to vindicate.
Paine trenchantly attacked Burke's claim that no people,
not even our own, had an inherent right to choose its own ruler,
and that the Revolution Settlement of 1688 was binding for
ever. Paine, on the contrary, asserted that "every age and
generation must be as free to act for itself <em>in all cases</em> as the
ages and generations that preceded it. The vanity and presumption
of governing beyond the grave is the most ridiculous
and insolent of all tyrannies." Further, on the general question
at issue, Paine remarked: "That men should take up arms, and
spend their lives and fortunes, <em>not</em> to maintain their rights, but
to maintain they have <em>not</em> rights, is an entirely new species of
discovery and suited to the paradoxical genius of Mr. Burke."
In reply to the noble passage: "The age of chivalry is gone&nbsp;...,"
Paine shrewdly says: "In the rhapsody of his imagination he
has discovered a world of windmills, and his sorrows are that
there are no Quixotes to attack them."</p>

<p>After thus exposing the weak points of the royalist case, Paine
proceeded to defend the mob, firstly, because the aristocratic
plots against the French Revolution were really formidable (a
very disputable thesis), and secondly, because the mob in all old
countries is the outcome of their unfair and brutal system of
government. "It is by distortedly exalting some men," he says,
"that others are distortedly debased, till the whole is out of
nature. A vast mass of mankind are degradedly thrown into
the background of the human picture, to bring forward with
greater glare the puppet show of State and aristocracy." Here
was obviously the Junius of democracy, for whom the only
effective answer was the gag and gyve. Indeed, Burke in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>"Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs" suggested that the
proper refutation was by means of "criminal justice."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Pitt's opinions at this time on French and English democracy
tend towards a moderate and reforming royalism&mdash;witness
his comment on Burke's "Reflections," that the writer would
have done well to extol the English constitution rather than to
attack the French.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In this remark we may detect his preference
for construction over destruction, for the allaying, rather than the
exciting, of passion. Nevertheless the one-sidedness of the English
constitution made for unrest. So soon as one bold voice
clearly contrasted those defects with the inspiring precepts of
the French Rights of Man, there was an end to political apathy.
A proof of this was furnished by the number of replies called
forth by Burke's "Reflections." They numbered thirty-eight.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Apart from that of Paine, the "Vindiciae Gallicae" of Sir
James Mackintosh made the most impression, especially the
last chapter, wherein he declared that the conspiracy of the
monarchs to crush the liberties of France would recoil on their
own heads.</p>

<p>Fear of the alleged royalist league quickened the sympathy of
Britons with the French reformers; while the sympathy of friends
of order with Louis&nbsp;XVI and Marie Antoinette after the Varennes
incident deepened their apprehension of all change. Thus were
called into play all the feelings which most deeply move mankind&mdash;love
of our richly storied past and its embodiment, the English
constitution; while on the other hand no small part of our people
harboured resentment against the narrow franchise and class
legislation at home, and felt a growing fear that the nascent
freedom of Frenchmen might expire under the heel of the
military Powers of Central Europe. Accordingly clubs and
societies grew apace, and many of them helped on the <span class="ins" title="circulalation">circulation</span>
of cheap editions of Paine's pamphlet.</p>

<p>The result of this clash of opinion was seen in the added
keenness of party strife and in the disturbances of 14th July
1791. The occasion of these last was the celebration by a subscription
dinner of the second anniversary of the fall of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>Bastille. Both at Manchester and Birmingham the announcement
of this insular and inoffensive function aroused strong feelings
either of envy or of opposition. The Tories of Manchester
resolved that, if the local Constitutional Club chose to dine on
that day it should be at their peril. The populace was urged to
pull down the hotel on their heads, "as the brains of every man
who dined there would be much improved by being mingled
with bricks and mortar." Thomas Walker's control of the local
constables sufficed to thwart this pleasantry.</p>

<p>But on that day the forces of reaction broke loose at Birmingham.
In the Midland capital political feeling ran as high as at
Manchester. The best known of the reformers was Dr. Priestley,
a Unitarian minister, whose researches in physical science had
gained him a world-wide reputation and a fellowship in the
Royal Society. He and many other reformers proposed to feast
in public in honour of the French national festival. Unfortunately,
the annoyance of the loyalists at this proposal was
inflamed by a recent sermon of Priestley on the death of
Dr. Price and by the circulation of a seditious handbill. Dr. Keir,
a Churchman who was to preside at the dinner, did not prove
to the satisfaction of all that this was a trick of the enemy.
Public opinion was also excited by the discovery of the words
"This barn to let" chalked on some of the churches of the
town; and charges were bandied to and fro that this was
the work of the Dissenters, or of the most virulent of their
opponents.</p>

<p>What is certain is that these <span lang="fr">hors d'&#0339;uvres</span> endangered the
rest of the <span lang="fr">menu</span>. The dinner-committee, however, struggled
manfully with their difficulties. They had a Churchman in the
chair, and Priestley was not present. The loyalty of the diners
also received due scenic warrant in the work of a local artist.
The dining-hall of the hotel was "decorated with three emblematical
pieces of sculpture, mixed with painting in a new style
of composition. The central was a finely executed medallion of
His Majesty, surrounded with a Glory, on each side of which
was an alabaster obelisk, one exhibiting Gallic Liberty breaking
the bonds of Despotism, and the other representing British
Liberty in its present enjoyment." The terms in which the
fourteen toasts were proposed breathed of the same flamboyant
loyalty, the only one open to criticism being the following: "The
Prince of Wales! May he have the wisdom to prefer the glory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of being the chief of an entire [<span lang="la">sic</span>] free people to that of being
only the splendid fountain of corruption."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The dinner passed with only occasional rounds of hissing
from the loyalists outside. But, as the evening wore on and the
speeches inside still continued, the crowd became restive. Stone-throwing
began and was not discouraged by the two magistrates,
the Rev. Dr. Spencer and John Carles, who had now arrived.
In fact, the clergyman with an oath praised a lad who said that
Priestley ought to be ducked; Carles also promised the rabble
drink; and when a local humourist asked for permission to
knock the dust out of Priestley's wig, the champions of order
burst out laughing. A witness at the trial averred that he saw
an attorney, John Brook, go among the mob and point towards
Priestley's chapel. However that may be, the rabble moved off
thither and speedily wrecked it. His residence at Fair Hill was
next demolished, his library and scientific instruments being
burnt or smashed. This was but the prelude to organized attacks
on the houses of the leading Nonconformists, whether they had
been at the dinner or not. The resulting riots soon involved in
ruin a large part of the town. Prominent Churchmen who
sought to end these disgraceful scenes suffered both in person
and property. A word of remonstrance sufficed to turn into
new channels the tide of hatred and greed; for, as happened in
the Gordon riots of 1780, rascality speedily rushed in to seize
the spoils.</p>

<p>The usually dull archives of the Home Office yield proof of
the terror that reigned in the Midland capital. A Mr. Garbett
wrote to Dundas on 17th July that the wrecking still went on,
that the Nonconformists were in the utmost dread and misery,
and all people looked for help from outside to stay the pillage.
As for himself, though he was not a "marked man," his hand
trembled at the scenes he had witnessed. There can be little
doubt that the magistrates from the first acted with culpable
weakness, as Whitbread proved in the House of Commons, for
they did not enrol special constables until the rioters had got the
upper hand. Dundas, as Home Secretary, seems to have done
his duty. The news of the riot of the 14th reached him at 10 a.m.
on the 15th (Friday); and he at once sent post haste to Nottingham,
ordering the immediate despatch of the 15th Dragoons.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>By dint of a forced march of fifty-six miles the horsemen
reached Birmingham on the evening of that same day (Sunday);
but two days more elapsed before drunken blackmailers ceased
to molest Hagley, Halesowen, and other villages. Few persons
lost their lives, except about a dozen of the pillagers who lay
helpless with drink in the cellars of houses which their more
zealous comrades had given over to the flames.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The verdict of Grenville was as follows: "I do not admire
riots in favour of Government much more than riots against it."
That of his less cautious brother, the Marquis of Buckingham, is
as follows: "I am not sorry for this <em>excess, excessive as it has
been</em>." That of Pitt is not recorded. He did not speak during
the debate on this subject on 21st May 1792; but the rejection
of Whitbread's motion for an inquiry by 189 votes to 46 implies
unanimity on the Ministerial side.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>In the winter of 1791&ndash;2 various incidents occurred which
further excited public opinion. On 17th February 1792 appeared
the second part of Paine's "Rights of Man." He started
from the assumption that the birth of a democratic State in
America would herald the advent of Revolutions not only in
France, but in all lands; and that British and Hessians would
live to bless the day when they were defeated by the soldiers
of Washington. He then proceeded to arraign all Governments
of the old type, and asserted that constitutions ought to be the
natural outcome of the collective activities of the whole people.
There was nothing mysterious about Government, if Courts had
not hidden away the patent fact that it dealt primarily with the
making and administering of laws. We are apt to be impressed
by these remarks until we contrast them with the majestic
period wherein Burke depicts human society as a venerable and
mysterious whole bequeathed by the wisdom of our forefathers.
An admirer of Burke cannot but quote the passage in full:
"Our political system is placed in a just correspondence and
symmetry with the order of the world, and with the mode of
existence decreed to a permanent body composed of transitory
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>parts; wherein by the disposition of a stupendous wisdom,
moulding together the great mysterious incorporation of the
human race, the whole, at one time, is never old, or middle-aged,
or young, but in a condition of unchangeable constancy,
moves on through the varied tenour of perpetual decay, fall, renovation
and progression. Thus, by preserving the method of
nature in the conduct of the State, in what we improve we are
never wholly new; in what we retain we are never wholly
obsolete."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>This is a majestic conception. But, after all, the practical
question at issue is&mdash;how much of the old shall we retain and
how much must be discarded? Unfortunately for himself and his
cause, Burke was now urging his countrymen to support two
military Powers in their effort to compel the French people to
revert to institutions which were alike obsolete and detested. Is
it surprising that Paine, utterly lacking all sense of reverence for
the past, should brand this conduct as treasonable to the imperious
needs of the present? Viewing monarchy as represented
by Versailles or Carlton House, and aristocracy by the intrigues
of Coblentz and the orgies of Brooks's Club, he gave short shrift
to both forms of Government. Monarchy he pronounced more
or less despotic; and under aristocracy (he says) the interests of
the whole body necessarily suffer; democracy alone secures the
rule of the general will; and this can be thoroughly secured only
in a democratic republic. He then attacks the English constitution
as unjust and extravagant, claiming that the formation
of a close alliance between England, France, and America
would enable the expenses of government (Army, Navy, and
Civil List inclusive) to be reduced to a million and a half a year.</p>

<p>With regard to the means of raising revenue, Paine sketched
a plan of progressive taxation on incomes, ranging from 3d. in
the pound on incomes less than &pound;500 to punitive proportions
after &pound;10,000 was reached; while in his Spartan arithmetic
great wealth appeared so dire a misfortune that he rid the
possessors of the whole of incomes of &pound;23,000 and upwards. As
for Pitt's financial reforms, he laughed them to scorn. He also
accused him of throwing over the fair promises that marked his
early career, of advertising for enemies abroad, while at home
he toadied to the Court. "The defect lies in the system....
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>Prop it as you please, it continually sinks into Court government,
and ever will." Finally he urged a limitation of armaments,
and prophesied that wars would cease when nations had their
freely elected Conventions. The cynic will remember with satisfaction
that, two months later, began the war between France
and Austria, which developed into the most tremendous series
of wars recorded in history.</p>

<p>The republican and levelling doctrines frankly advocated in
Paine's second pamphlet made a greater sensation than the first
part had done; and Fox, who approved the former production,
sternly reprobated the latter. It is possible that Government
sought to stop its publication; for Chapman, the publisher, to
whom Paine first applied, offered him &pound;1,000 for the manuscript,
and yet very soon afterwards declared it to be too dangerous for
him to print.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Certainly the work soon quickened the tone of
political thought. Already the London Society for promoting
Constitutional Information, which had died of inanition in 1784,
had come to life again before the close of the year 1791. And
at the end of that year a determined man, Thomas Hardy,
a poor shoemaker of Westminster, set to work to interest his
comrades in politics. He assembled four men at an ale-house,
and they agreed to take action. At their second meeting, on
25th January 1792, they mustered eight strong, and resolved to
start "The London Corresponding Society for the Reform of
Parliamentary Representation." Its finances were scarcely on a
par with its title: they consisted of eightpence, the first weekly
subscription. But the idea proved infectious; and amidst the
heat engendered by Paine's second pamphlet, the number of
members rose to forty-one.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The first manifesto of the Society,
dated 2nd April, claimed political liberty as the birthright of
man, declared the British nation to be misrepresented by its Parliament,
and, while repudiating all disorderly methods, demanded
a thorough reform of that body.</p>

<p>So far as I have been able to discover, this was the first
political club started by English working-men at that time. But
now the men of Sheffield also organized themselves. Their
"Association" began in an assembly of five or six mechanics,
who discussed "the enormous high price of provisions" and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>"the waste and lavish [<span lang="la">sic</span>] of the public property by placemen,
pensioners, luxury and debauchery,&mdash;sources of the grievous
burthens under which the nation groans." The practical
character of their lamentations attracted many working men,
with the result that they resolved to reprint and circulate 1,600
copies of Paine's "Rights of Man" (Part&nbsp;I), at sixpence a copy.
On 15th January 1792 they wrote up to the "London Society
for Constitutional Information" to plan co-operation with them.</p>

<p>At first the ideas of the Sheffield Association were somewhat
parochial. But the need of common action all over the Kingdom
was taking shape in several minds, and when Scotland awoke
to political activity (as will appear in <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter&nbsp;VII</a>) the idea
of a General Convention took firm root and led to remarkable
developments. For the present, the chief work of these clubs
was the circulation of Paine's volumes (even in Welsh, Gaelic,
and Erse) at the price of sixpence or even less. They also distributed
"The Catechism of the French Constitution" (of 1791),
drawn up by Christie, a Scot domiciled at Paris, which set forth
the beauties of that child of many hopes. Less objectionable
was a pamphlet&mdash;"The Rights of Men and the Duties of Men."
For the most part, however, their literature was acridly republican
in tone and of a levelling tendency. Thus, for the first time
since the brief attempt of the Cromwellian Levellers, the rich
and the poor began to group themselves in hostile camps, at the
strident tones of Paine's cry for a graduated Income Tax. Is it
surprising that the sight of the free institutions of France and of
the forced economy of the Court of the Tuileries should lead our
workers to question the utility of the State-paid debaucheries of
Carlton House, and of the whole system of patronage and pensions?
Burke and Pitt had pruned away a few of the worst excrescences;
but now they saw with dismay the whole of the body
politic subjected to remorseless criticism by those whose duty
was to toil and not to think or question.</p>

<p>This was a new departure in eighteenth-century England.
Hitherto working men had taken only a fleeting and fitful interest
in politics. How should they do so in days when newspapers
were very dear, and their contents had only the remotest bearing
on the life of the masses? The London mob had bawled and
rioted for "Wilkes and Liberty," but mainly from personal
motives and love of horse-play. Now, however, all was changed;
and artisans were willing to sacrifice their time and their pence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
to learn and teach a political catechism, and spread the writings
of Paine. Consequently the new Radical Clubs differed widely
from the short-lived County Associations of 1780 which charged
a substantial fee for membership. Moreover, these Associations
expired in the years 1783&ndash;4, owing to the disgust at Fox's
Coalition with Lord North. We are therefore justified in declaring
that English democracy entered on a new lease of life,
and did not, as has been asserted,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> merely continue the movement
of 1780. The earlier efforts had been wholly insular in
character; they aimed at staying the tide of corruption; their
methods were in the main academic, and certainly never affected
the great mass of the people. Now reformers were moved by
a wider enthusiasm for the rights of humanity, and sought not
merely to abolish pocket boroughs and sinecures, but to level
up the poor and level down the wealthy. It was this aspect of
Paine's teaching that excited men to a frenzy of reprobation or
of hope.</p>

<p>A certain continuity of tradition and method is observable in
a club, called The Friends of the People, which was founded at
Freemasons' Tavern in April 1792, with a subscription of five
guineas a year. The members included Cartwright, Erskine,
Lord Edward Fitzgerald, Philip Francis, Charles Grey, Lambton,
the Earl of Lauderdale, Mackintosh, Sheridan, Whitbread, and
some sixty others; but Fox refused to join. Their profession
of faith was more moderate than that of Hardy's Club; it
emphasized the need of avoiding innovation and of restoring
the constitution to its original purity.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> This was in the spirit
of the Associations of 1780; but the new club was far less
characteristic of the times than the clubs of working men described
above.</p>

<p>The appearance of Paine's "Rights of Man" (Part&nbsp;II), the
founding of these societies, and the outbreak of war between
France and Austria in April 1792 made a deep impression on
Pitt. He opposed a notice of a motion of Reform for the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
session, brought forward by Grey on 30th April. While
affirming his continued interest in that subject, Pitt deprecated
its introduction at that time as involving the risk of anarchy.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>My object [he continued] always has been, and is now more particularly
so, to give permanence to that which we actually enjoy rather than
remove subsisting grievances.... I once thought, and still think, upon
the point of the representation of the Commons, that, if some mode
could be adopted by which the people could have any additional
security for a continuance of the blessings which they now enjoy, it
would be an improvement in the constitution of this country. That was
the extent of my object. Further I never wished to go; and if this can be
obtained without the risk of losing what we have, I should think it wise
to make the experiment. When I say this, it is not because I believe
there is any existing grievance in this country that is felt at this hour.</p>
</div>


<p>At the end of the American War (he continued) when bankruptcy
seemed imminent, he believed Reform to be necessary in
order to restore public confidence and remedy certain notorious
grievances. Even then very many moderate men opposed his
efforts as involving danger to the State. How much more would
they deprecate sweeping proposals which rightly aroused general
apprehension? He then censured the action of certain members
of the House in joining an Association (the "Friends of the
People") which was supported by those who aimed at the overthrowing
of hereditary monarchy, titles of nobility, and all ideas
of subordination. He would oppose all proposals for Reform
rather than run the risk of changes so sweeping.&mdash;"All, all may
be lost by an indiscreet attempt upon the subject." Clearly, Pitt
was about to join the ranks of the alarmists. But members
generally were of his opinion. In vain did Fox, Erskine, Grey,
and Sheridan deprecate the attempt to confuse moderate Reform
with reckless innovation. Burke illogically but effectively
dragged in the French spectre, and Windham declared that
the public mind here, as in other lands, was in such a state that
the slightest scratch might produce a mortal wound.</p>

<p>The gulf between Pitt and the reformers now became impassable.
His speech of 10th May against any relaxation of the
penal laws against Unitarians is a curious blend of bigotry
and panic. Eleven days later a stringent proclamation was issued
against all who wrote, printed, and dispersed "divers wicked and
seditious writings." It ordered all magistrates to search out the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
authors and abettors of them, and to take steps for preventing
disorder. It also inculcated "a due submission to the laws, and
a just confidence in the integrity and wisdom of Parliament."
Anything less calculated to beget such a confidence than this
proclamation, threatening alike to reformers and levellers, can
scarcely be conceived. On 25th May Grey opposed it in an
acrid speech; he inveighed against Pitt as an apostate, who
never kept his word, and always intended to delude Parliament
and people. The sting of the speech lay, not in these reckless
charges, but in the citing of Pitt's opinions as expressed in a
resolution passed at the Thatched House Tavern in May 1782,
which declared that without Parliamentary Reform neither the
liberty of the nation nor the permanence of a virtuous administration
was secure. Pitt's reply, however, convinced all those
whose minds were open to conviction. He proved to demonstration
that he had never approved of universal suffrage; yet
that was now the goal aimed at by Paine and the Societies
founded on the basis of the Rights of Man. The speech of
Dundas also showed that the writings of Paine, and the founding
of clubs with those ends in view, had led to the present
action of the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly those clubs had behaved in a provocative manner.
Apart from their correspondence with the Jacobins Club
(which will be described later), they advocated aims which then
seemed utterly subversive of order. Thus, early in May 1792,
the Sheffield Society declared their object to be "a radical Reform
of the country, as soon as prudence and discretion would permit,
and established on that system which is consistent with
the Rights of Man." Further, the hope is expressed that not
only the neighbouring towns and villages, most of which were
forming similar societies, but also the whole country would be
"united in the same cause, which cannot fail of being the case
wherever the most excellent works of Thomas Paine find reception."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Now, this banding together of societies and clubs pointed the
way to the forming of a National Convention which would truly
represent the whole nation. In judging the action of Pitt and
his colleagues at this crisis, we must remember that they had
before them the alarming example of the Jacobins Club of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>Paris, which had gained enormous power by its network of
affiliated clubs. This body again was modelled on the various
societies of the Illuminati in Germany, whose organizer, Weishaupt,
summed up his contention in the words: "All their union
shall be carried on by the correspondence and visits of the
brethren. If we can gain but that point, we shall have succeeded
in all we want."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> This is why the name Corresponding Society
stank in the nostrils of all rulers. It implied a parasitic organization
which, if allowed to grow, would strangle the established
Government. Signs were not wanting that this was the aim of
the new Radical Clubs. Thus the delegates of the United Constitutional
Societies who met at Norwich drew up on 24th
March 1792 resolutions expressing satisfaction at the rapid
growth of those bodies, already numbering some hundreds,
"which by delegates preserve a mutual intercourse."&nbsp;... "To
Mr. Thomas Paine our thanks are specially due for his first and
second parts of the 'Rights of Man'; and we sincerely wish that
he may live to see his labours crowned with success in the
general diffusion of liberty and happiness among mankind."&nbsp;...
"We&nbsp;... earnestly entreat our brethren to increase in their
Associations in order to form one grand and extensive Union of
all the friends of liberty."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> It is not surprising that this plan of
a National Convention of levellers produced something like a
panic among the well-to-do; and it is futile to assert that men
who avowed their belief in the subversive teaching of Part&nbsp;II of
Paine's book were concerned merely with the Reform of Parliament.
They put that object in their public manifestoes; but,
like many of the Chartists of a later date, their ultimate aim was
the redistribution of wealth; and this it was which brought on
them the unflinching opposition of Pitt.</p>

<p>Nevertheless even these considerations do not justify him in
opposing the reformers root and branch. The greatest statesman
is he who distinguishes between the real grievances of a suffering
people and the visionary or dangerous schemes which they beget
in ill-balanced brains. To oppose moderate reformers as well as
extremists is both unjust and unwise. It confounds together
the would-be healers and the enemies of the existing order.
Furthermore, an indiscriminate attack tends to close the ranks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>in a solid phalanx, and it should be the aim of a tactician first
to seek to loosen those ranks.</p>

<p>Finally, we cannot forget that Pitt had had it in his power to
redress the most obvious of the grievances which kept large
masses of his countrymen outside the pale of political rights and
civic privilege. Those grievances were made known to him
temperately in the years 1787, 1789, and 1790; but he refused
to amend them, and gradually drifted to the side of the alarmists
and reactionaries. Who is the wiser guide at such a time? He
who sets to work betimes to cure certain ills which are producing
irritation in the body politic? Or he who looks on the
irritation as a sign that nothing should be done? The lessons of
history and the experience of everyday life plead for timely cure
and warn against a nervous postponement. Doubtless Pitt
would have found it difficult to persuade some of his followers
to apply the knife in the session of 1791 or 1792. But in the
Parliament elected in 1790 his position was better assured, his
temper more imperious, than in that of 1785, which needed much
tactful management. The fact, then, must be faced that he declined
to run the risk of the curative operation, even at a time when
there were no serious symptoms in the patient and little or no
risk for the surgeon.</p>

<p>The reason which he assigned for his refusal claims careful
notice. It was that his earlier proposals (those of 1782&ndash;5) had
aimed at national security; while those of the present would
tend to insecurity. Possibly in the month of April 1792 this
argument had some validity; though up to that time all the
violence had been on the Tory side. But the plea does not
excuse Pitt for not taking action in the year 1790. That was
the period when the earlier apathy of the nation to Reform
was giving way to interest, and interest had not yet grown into
excitement. Still less had loyalty waned under the repressive
measures whereby he now proposed to give it vigour.</p>

<p>Thus, Pitt missed a great opportunity, perhaps the greatest of
his career. What it means is clear to us, who know that the
cause of Reform passed under a cloud for the space of thirty-eight
years. It is of course unfair to censure him and his friends
for lacking a prophetic vision of the long woes that were to
come. Most of the blame lavished upon him arises from forgetfulness
of the fact that he was not a seer mounted on some
political Pisgah, but a pioneer struggling through an unexplored<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
jungle. Nevertheless, as the duty of a pioneer is not merely to
hew a path, but also to note the lie of the land and the signs of
the weather, we must admit that Pitt did not possess the highest
instincts of his craft. He cannot be ranked with Julius Caesar,
Charlemagne, Alfred the Great, Edward&nbsp;I, or Burleigh, still less
with those giants of his own age, Napoleon and Stein; for these
men boldly grappled with the elements of unrest or disloyalty,
and by wise legislation wrought them into the fabric of the State.
Probably the lack of response to his reforming efforts in the year
1785 ingrained in him the conviction that Britons would always
be loyal if their burdens were lessened and their comforts increased;
and now in 1792 he looked on the remissions of taxation
(described in the <a href="#CHAPTER_II">following chapter</a>) as a panacea against discontent.
Under normal conditions that would have been the case.
It was not so now, because new ideas were in the air, and these
forbade a bovine acceptance of abundant fodder. In truth, Pitt
had not that gift without which the highest abilities and the most
strenuous endeavours will at novel crises be at fault&mdash;a sympathetic
insight into the needs and aspirations of the people. His
analytical powers enabled him to detect the follies of the royalist
crusaders; but he lacked those higher powers of synthesis which
alone could discern the nascent strength of Democracy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="title spaced">BEFORE THE STORM</p>

<p class="quote">I find it to be a very general notion, at least in the Assembly, that if France
can preserve a neutrality with England, she will be able to cope with all the
rest of Europe united.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gower to Grenville</span>, <i>22nd April 1792</i>.</p>


<p>Indirect evidence as to the intentions of a statesman is
often more convincing than his official assertions. The world
always suspects the latter; and many politicians have found it
expedient to adopt the ironical device practised frequently with
success by Bismarck on his Austrian colleagues at Frankfurt,
that of telling the truth. Fortunately the English party game
has nearly always been kept up with sportsmanlike fair play;
and Pitt himself was so scrupulously truthful that we are rarely
in doubt as to his opinions, save when he veiled them by ministerial
reserve. Nevertheless, on the all-important subject of his
attitude towards Revolutionary France, it is satisfactory to have
indirect proofs of his desire to maintain a strict, if not friendly,
neutrality. This proof lies in his handling of the nation's armaments
and finances.</p>

<p>The debate on the Army Estimates on 15th February 1792 is
of interest in more respects than one. The news of the definitive
signature of peace between Russia and Turkey by the Treaty
of Jassy, put an end to the last fears of a resumption of war in
the East; and, as the prospects were equally pacific in the
West, the Ministry carried out slight reductions in the land
forces. These were fixed in the year 1785 at seventy-three
regiments of 410 men each, divided into eight companies, with
two companies <span lang="fr">en second</span>. In 1789 the number of companies per
regiment was fixed at ten, without any companies <span lang="fr">en second</span>.
Now the Secretary at War, Sir Charles Yonge, proposed further
reductions, which, with those of 1789, would lessen each regiment
by seventy privates, and save the country the sum of
&pound;51,000. No diminution was proposed in the number of officers;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and this gave Fox a handle for an attack. He said that the
natural plan would be to reduce the number of regiments to
sixty-four. Instead of that, the number of seventy regiments was
retained, and new corps were now proposed for the East Indies,
one for the West Indies, and one for Canada, chiefly to be used
for pioneer work and clearance of woods. General Burgoyne
and Fox protested against the keeping up of skeleton regiments,
the latter adding the caustic comment that the plan was "the
least in point of saving and the greatest in point of patronage."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The practices prevalent in that age give colour to the charge.
On the other hand, professional men have defended a system
which kept up the <span lang="fr">cadres</span> of regiments in time of peace, as providing
a body of trained officers and privates, which in time of
war could be filled out by recruits. Of course it is far inferior
to the plan of a reserve of trained men; but that plan had not
yet been hammered out by Scharnhorst, under the stress of the
Napoleonic domination in Prussia. As to the reduction of seven
men per company, now proposed, it may have been due partly
to political reasons. Several reports in the Home Office and
War Office archives prove that discontent was rife among the
troops, especially in the northern districts, on account of insufficient
pay and the progress of Radical propaganda among
them. The reduction may have afforded the means of sifting
out the ringleaders.</p>

<p>Retrenchment, if not Reform, was the order of the day. Pitt
discerned the important fact that a recovery in the finance and
trade of the country must be encouraged through a series of
years to produce a marked effect. For then the application of
capital to industry, and the increase in production and revenue
can proceed at the rate of compound interest. Already his hopes,
for which he was indebted to the "Wealth of Nations,"<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> had
been largely realized. The Report of the Select Committee of
the House of Commons presented in May 1791 showed the
following growth in the ordinary revenue (exclusive of the Land
and Malt Taxes):</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="5" summary="Growth in revenue">
<tr><td>1786</td><td class="right">&pound;11,867,055</td></tr>
<tr><td>1787</td><td class="right">12,923,134</td></tr>

</table>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p><p>During those five years the sum of &pound;4,750,000 had been
allotted to the Sinking Fund for the payment of the National
Debt; and a further sum of &pound;674,592, accruing from the interest
of stock and expired annuities, had gone towards the same object&mdash;a
crushing retort to the taunts of Fox and Sheridan, that the
Sinking Fund was a mere pretence. On the whole the sum of
&pound;5,424,592 had been paid off from the National Debt in five
years. It is therefore not surprising that three per cent. Consols,
which were down at fifty-four when Pitt took office at the
end of 1783, touched ninety in the year 1791. The hopes and
fears of the year 1792 find expression in the fact that in March
they stood at ninety-seven, and in December dropped to seventy-four.</p>

<p>For the present Pitt entertained the highest hopes. In his
Budget Speech of 17th February he declared the revenue to be
in so flourishing a state that he could grant relief to the taxpayers.
In the year 1791 the permanent taxes had yielded
&pound;14,132,000; and those on land and malt brought the total up
to &pound;16,690,000; but he proposed to take &pound;16,212,000 as the
probable revenue for the following year. The expenditure would
be lessened by &pound;104,000 on the navy (2,000 seamen being discharged),
and about &pound;50,000 on the army; &pound;36,000 would also
be saved by the non-renewal of the subsidy for Hessian troops.
There were, however, additions, due to the establishment of the
Government of Upper Canada, and the portions allotted to the
Duke of York (on the occasion of his marriage with a Prussian
princess) and the Duke of Clarence. The expenditure would,
therefore, stand at &pound;15,811,000; but, taking the average of four
years, he reckoned the probable surplus at no more than
&pound;401,000. On the other hand, he anticipated no new expenses
except for the fortification of posts in the West Indies and the
completion of forts for the further protection of the home dockyards.
On the whole, then, he reckoned that he had &pound;600,000 to
spare; and of this amount he proposed to allocate &pound;400,000 to
the reduction of the National Debt and the repeal of the extra
duty on malt, an impost much disliked by farmers. He also
announced a remission of permanent taxes to the extent of
&pound;200,000, namely, on female servants, carts, and waggons, and
that of three shillings on each house having less than seven
windows. These were burdens that had undoubtedly affected
the poor. Further, he hoped to add the sum of &pound;200,000 every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
year to the Sinking Fund, and he pointed out that, at this rate
of payment, that fund would amount to &pound;4,000,000 per annum
in the space of fifteen years, after which time the interest might
be applied to the relief of the nation's burdens.</p>

<p>Then, rising high above the level of facts and figures, he ventured
on this remarkable prophecy:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>I am not, indeed, presumptuous enough to suppose that, when I
name fifteen years, I am not naming a period in which events may arise
which human foresight cannot reach, and which may baffle all our conjectures.
We must not count with certainty on a continuance of our
present prosperity during such an interval; but unquestionably there
never was a time in the history of this country, when, from the situation
of Europe, we might more reasonably expect fifteen years of peace than
at the present moment.</p>
</div>


<p>Imagination pictures what might possibly have been the outcome
of events if Great Britain and France had continued to
exert on one another the peaceful and mutually beneficent
influence which Pitt had sought to bring about. In that case, we
can imagine the reformed French monarchy, or a Republic of the
type longed for by Mme. Roland, permeating the thought and
action of neighbouring States, until the cause of Parliamentary
Reform in England, and the cognate efforts for civic and religious
liberty on the Continent achieved a lasting triumph. That
Pitt cherished these hopes is seen not only in his eloquent words,
but in the efforts which he put forth to open up the world to
commerce. The year 1792 ought to be remembered, not only for
the outbreak of war and the horrors of the September massacres
at Paris, but also for the attempt to inaugurate friendly relations
with China. Pitt set great store by the embassy which he at this
time sent out to Pekin under the lead of Lord Macartney. In
happier times this enterprise might have served to link East and
West in friendly intercourse; and Europe, weary of barren strifes,
would have known no other rivalries than those of peace.</p>

<p>Alas: this is but a mirage. As it fades away, we discern an
arid waste. War broke out between France and Austria within
two months of this sanguine utterance. It soon embroiled France
and England in mortal strife. All hope of retrenchment and
Reform was crushed. The National Debt rose by leaps and
bounds, and the Sinking Fund proved to be a snare. Taxation
became an ever-grinding evil, until the poor, whose lot Pitt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
hoped to lighten, looked on him as the harshest of taskmasters,
the puppet of kings, and the paymaster of the Continental
Coalition. The spring of the year 1807 found England burdened
beyond endurance, the Third Coalition stricken to death by the
blows of Napoleon, while Pitt had fourteen months previously
succumbed to heart-breaking toils and woes.</p>

<p>Before adverting to the complications with France which were
thenceforth to absorb his energies, I must refer to some incidents
of the session and summer of the year 1792.</p>

<p>One of the most noteworthy enactments was Fox's Libel Bill.
In May 1791 that statesman had proposed to the House of
Commons to subject cases of libel to the award of juries, not of
judges. Pitt warmly approved the measure, maintaining that,
far from protecting libellers, it would have the contrary effect.
The Bill passed the Commons on 31st May; but owing to
dilatory and factious procedure in the Lords, it was held over
until the year 1792. Thanks to the noble plea for liberty urged
by the venerable Earl Camden, it passed on 21st May.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> It is
matter of congratulation that Great Britain gained this new safeguard
for freedom of speech before she encountered the storms
of the revolutionary era.</p>

<p>There is little else to chronicle except two occurrences which
displayed the power and the foresight of Pitt. They were the
fall of Thurlow and the endeavour of the Prime Minister to form
a working alliance with the Old Whigs. The former of these
events greatly impressed the contemporaries of Pitt, who likened
the ejected Chancellor to Lucifer or to a Titan blasted by Jove's
thunderbolt. In this age we find it difficult to account for the
prestige of Thurlow. His legal learning was far from profound,
his speeches were more ponderous than powerful, and his attacks
were bludgeon blows rather than home thrusts. Of the lighter
graces and social gifts he had scant store. Indeed, his private
life displayed no redeeming feature. Everyone disliked him, but
very many feared him, mainly, perhaps, because of his facility
for intrigue, his power of bullying, and his great influence at
Court. As we have seen, the conciliatory efforts of the monarch
had hitherto averted a rupture between Pitt and Thurlow. But
not even the favour of George&nbsp;III could render the crabbed old
Chancellor endurable. His spitefulness had increased since Pitt's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>nomination of Pepper Arden to the Mastership of the Rolls;
and he showed his spleen by obstructing Government measures
in the House of Lords. In April 1792 he flouted Pitt's efforts on
behalf of the abolition of the Slave Trade; and on 15th May he
ridiculed his proposal that to every new State loan a Sinking
Fund should necessarily be appended. The Commons had
passed this measure; but in the Lords Thurlow spoke contemptuously
of the proposal; and his influence, if not his arguments,
brought the Government majority down to six.</p>

<p>Pitt was furious. Despite a letter from Windsor urging the
need of forbearance in the interests of the public service, he
resolved to end this intolerable situation. Respectfully but firmly
he begged the King to decide between him and Thurlow. The
result was a foregone conclusion. Having to choose between an
overbearing Chancellor, and a Prime Minister whose tact, firmness,
and transcendent abilities formed the keystone of the
political fabric, the King instructed Dundas to request Thurlow
to deliver up the Great Seal.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> For the convenience of public
business, his resignation was deferred to the end of the session,
which came at the middle of June. The Great Seal was then
placed in commission until January 1793 when Lord Loughborough,
formerly a follower of the Prince of Wales and Fox,
became Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p>The dismissal of Thurlow is interesting on general as well as
constitutional grounds. It marks an important step in the evolution
of the Cabinet. Thenceforth the will of the Prime Minister
was held to be paramount whenever any one of his colleagues
openly and sharply differed from him. Thus the authority of
the Prime Minister became more clearly defined. Not even the
favour of the Sovereign could thenceforth uphold a Minister who
openly opposed and scorned the head of the Cabinet. The recognition
of this fact has undoubtedly conduced to the amenity
of parliamentary life; for etiquette has imposed on Ministers the
observance of outward signs of deference to their chief, and
(save a few times in the breezy careers of Canning and Palmerston)
dissensions have been confined to the council chamber.</p>

<p>As to Thurlow's feelings, they appear in his frank admission
to Sir John Scott, the future Chancellor, Lord Eldon: "I did not
think that the King would have parted with me so easily. As
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>to that other man [Pitt], he has done to me just what I should
have done to him if I could."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> It is not often that a plotter
shows his hand so clearly; and we must admire Pitt's discernment
no less than his firmness at this crisis. Would that he had
found a more faithful successor. Possibly some suspicion as to
Loughborough's powers of intrigue led Pitt to make cautious
advances to that promising lawyer, Sir John Scott. To his
honour, be it said, Scott at once declared that he must cease to
be Solicitor-General, as he had received much assistance from
Thurlow. In vain did Pitt expostulate with him. At last he
persuaded him to consult Thurlow, who advised him to do
nothing so foolish, seeing that Pitt would be compelled at some
future time to confer the Great Seal upon him. With this parting
gleam of insight and kindliness, the morose figure of Thurlow
vanishes.</p>

<p>More than once in the session of 1792 rumours were afloat as
to a reconstruction of the Cabinet. Early in that year, when the
debates on the Russian armament somewhat shook Pitt's position,
it was stated that the King desired to get rid of him.
Gillray heard of the story, and visualized it with his usual skill.
He represented the Marquis of Lansdowne ("Malagrida") as
driving at full speed to St. James's Palace, heralded by the dove
of peace, while Fox, Sheridan, etc., hang on behind and cry
out, "Stop; stop; take us in." Pitt and Dundas are seen leaving
the palace. The rumour gains in credibility from a Memorandum
of the Marquis; but it is doubtful whether George ever
thought seriously of giving up Pitt, still less of seeking support
from the discredited and unpopular Lansdowne, whose views on
the French Revolution were utterly opposed to those of the
King. Probably the King put questions to him merely with the
view of gratifying his own curiosity and exciting unreal hopes.
Certainly Pitt scoffed at the idea of resignation. On 3rd March
he referred to the rumour, in a letter to the Earl of Westmorland,
merely to dismiss it as ridiculous.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Far more important were the negotiations that began in May&ndash;June
1792. Pitt paved the way for a union with the Old Whigs
by consulting the opinions of the Duke of Portland and other
leading Whigs, assembled at Burlington House, respecting the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>proclamation against seditious writings. They suggested a few
alterations in his draft and he adopted them. Fox alone declared
against the whole scheme, and afterwards hotly opposed
it in the House of Commons. This step having shown the
cleavage in the Whig party, Dundas and Loughborough sought
to effect a union of the Portland Whigs with the Government.
The Duke of Portland strongly approved of it. Even Fox welcomed
the proposal, but only on the understanding that the
Whigs joined the Ministry on fair and even terms, sharing
equally in the patronage. The Duke further suggested that Pitt
should give up the Treasury and allow a neutral man like the
Duke of Leeds to take that office. We can picture the upward
tilt of the nose with which Pitt received this proposal.</p>

<p>Lord Malmesbury, who was present at this discussion of the
Whig leaders on 13th June, himself saw great difficulties in such
a plan, as also from the opposition of the King and the Prince
of Wales. On the next day Loughborough met Pitt at Dundas's
house, and reported him to be favourable to the idea of a coalition.
Pitt further said that the King and the Queen would welcome
it, except in so far as it concerned Fox, whose conduct in
Parliament during the last few months had given great offence.
Pitt further declared that he did not remember a single word in
all the disputes with Fox which could prevent him honourably
and consistently acting with him. He added that it
might be difficult to give him the Foreign Office at once, but he
could certainly have it in a few months' time. On 16th June
Malmesbury saw Fox at Burlington House, and found him in an
unusually acrid and suspicious mood, from the notion that the
whole affair was a plot of Pitt to break up the Whig party. Beside
which, Fox said that it was idle to expect Pitt to admit the
Whig leaders on an equal footing. Malmesbury, however, maintained
that, if Fox and the Duke were agreed, they would lead
the whole of their party with them, at which remark Fox
became silent and embarrassed.</p>

<p>Pitt, on the other hand, was very open to Loughborough, and
expressed a wish to form a strong and united Ministry which
could face the difficulties of the time. The chief obstacle to a
coalition, he said, was Fox's support of French principles,
which must preclude his taking the Foreign Office immediately.
The remark is noteworthy as implying Pitt's expectation that
either Fox might tone down his opinions, or the Revolution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
might abate its violence. Further, when Loughborough reminded
him of the ardour of his advocacy of the Abolitionist cause, he
replied that some concession must be made on that head, as the
King strongly objected to the way in which it was pushed on by
addresses and petitions, a method which he himself disliked.
Further, he freely admitted that the "national Aristocracy" of
the country must have its due weight and power.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> These confessions
(assuming that Loughborough reported them correctly)
prepare us for the half right turn which now becomes the trend
of Pitt's political career. In order to further the formation of a
truly national party, he was willing, if necessary, to postpone
the cause of the slaves and of Parliamentary Reform until the
advent of calmer times.</p>

<p>At this stage of the discussions, then, Pitt was willing to
meet the Whigs half way. But the chief difficulty lay, not
with Fox and his friends, but with the King. When Pitt mentioned
the proposal to him, there came the characteristic reply:
"Anything complimentary to them, but no power."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> How was
it possible to harmonize this resolve with that of Fox, that the
Whigs must have an equality of power? Grenville was a further
obstacle. How could that stiff and ambitious man give up the
Foreign Office to Fox, whose principles he detested? We hear
little of Grenville in these days, probably because of his marriage
to Lady Ann Pitt, daughter of Lord Camelford. But
certainly he would not have tolerated a half Whig Cabinet.</p>

<p>It is therefore strange that the proposals were ever renewed.
Renewed, however, they were, in the second week of July. Loughborough
having spread the impression that Pitt desired their renewal,
Leeds was again pushed to the front, it being suggested
that he might be First Lord of the Treasury. Finally, on 14th
August, the King granted him a private interview at Windsor,
but stated that nothing had been said on the subject for a long
time, and that it had never been seriously considered, it being
impossible for Pitt to give up the Treasury and act as <span lang="fr">Commis</span> to
the Whig leaders. This statement should have lessened the
Duke's astonishment at hearing from Pitt on 22nd August that
there had been no thought of any change in the Government.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
This assertion seems to belie Pitt's reputation for truthfulness.
But it is noteworthy that Grenville scarcely refers to the discussions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
on this subject, deeply though it concerned him. Further,
Rose, who was in close touch with Ministers, wrote to Auckland
on 13th July that he had heard only through the newspapers
of the "negotiations for a sort of Coalition," and that he knew
there had been none; that Dundas had conferred with Loughborough,
but there had been no negotiation.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Now the proneness of these two men to scheming and intrigue
is well known; and it seems probable that they so skilfully
pulled the wires at Burlington House as to quicken the appetites
of the Whig leaders. Dundas may have acted with a view to
breaking up the Whig party, and Loughborough in order to
bring about a general shuffle of the cards favourable to himself.
Malmesbury and others, whose desires or interests lay in a union
of the Portland Whigs with Pitt, furthered the scheme, and gave
full credence to Loughborough's reports. But we may doubt
whether Pitt took the affair seriously after the crushing declaration
of the King: "Anything complimentary to them, but no
power." The last blow to the scheme was dealt by Pitt in an
interview with Loughborough, so we may infer from the following
letter from George&nbsp;III to the former:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Weymouth, <i>August 20, 1792</i>.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>I cannot but think Mr. Pitt has judged right in seeing Lord Loughborough,
as that will convince him, however [whoever?] were parties to
the proposal brought by the Duke of Leeds, that the scheme can never
succeed: that the Duke of Portland was equally concerned with the
former appeared clearly from his letters....</p>
</div>


<p>The King, then, looked on the whole affair as a Whig plot;
and Pitt, whatever his feelings were at first, finally frowned upon
the proposal. Doubtless, in an official sense, there was justification
for his remark to the Duke of Leeds, that the coalition had
never been in contemplation; for the matter seems never to have
come before the Cabinet. But as a statement between man and
man it leaves something to be desired on the score of accuracy.
Annoyance at the very exalted position marked out for the
Duke, whose capacity Pitt rated decidedly low, may have led him
to belittle the whole affair; for signs of constraint and annoyance
are obvious in his other answers to his late colleague.
There, then, we must leave this question, involved in something
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>of mystery.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> We shall not be far wrong in concluding that Pitt
wished for the formation of a national Ministry, and that the
plan failed, partly from the resolve of Fox never to play second
to Pitt; and still more from the personal way in which the King
regarded the suggestion.</p>

<p>The King meanwhile had marked his sense of the value of
Pitt's services by pressing on him the honourable position of
Warden of the Cinque Ports, with a stipend of &pound;3,000 a year,
intimating at the same time that he would not hear of his
declining it (6th August).<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> It is a proof of the spotless purity of
Pitt's reputation that not a single libel or gibe appeared in the
Press on his acceptance of this almost honorary post.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>One brilliant recruit to the Whig ranks was now won over to
the national cause, of which Pitt was seen to be the incarnation.
Already at Eton and Oxford George Canning had shown the
versatility of his genius and the precocious maturity of his
eloquence. When his Oxford friend, Jenkinson (the future Earl
of Liverpool) made a sensational <span lang="fr">d&eacute;but</span> in the House on the Tory
side, Sheridan remarked that the Whigs would soon provide an
antidote in the person of young Canning. Great, then, was their
annoyance when the prodigy showed signs of breaking away
from the society of the Crewes and Sheridan, in order to ally
himself with Pitt. So little is known respecting the youth of
Canning that the motives which prompted his breach with
Sheridan are involved in uncertainty. It is clear, however, from
his own confession that, after some discussion with Orde, he
himself made the first offer of allegiance to Pitt in a letter of 26th
July 1792. He then informed the Prime Minister that, though on
terms of friendship with eminent members of the Opposition, he
was "in no way bound to them by any personal or political
obligation," and was therefore entirely free to choose his own
party; that he was ambitious of being connected with Pitt, but
lacked the means to win an election, and yet refused to be
brought in by any individual&mdash;a reference, seemingly, to an offer
made to him by the Duke of Portland. In reply, Pitt proposed
an interview at Downing Street on Wednesday, 15th August.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>At noon on that day the two men first met. We can picture
them as they faced one another in the formal surroundings of
the Prime Minister's study. Pitt, at this time thirty-three years
of age, had lost some of the slimness of youth, but his figure
was bony, angular, and somewhat awkward. His face was as
yet scarcely marked by the slight Bacchic blotches which told
of carouses with Dundas at Wimbledon. Months and years of
triumph (apart from the Russian defeat) had stiffened his confidence
and pride; but the fateful shadow of the French Revolution
must have struck a chill to his being, especially then, on the
arrival of news of the pitiable surrender of Louis&nbsp;XVI and
Marie Antoinette, and the shooting down of the Swiss Guards
at the Tuileries. No royalist could look on the future without
inward shuddering; and both these men were ardent royalists.
We know from Canning's confession that it was the starting of
the club, the Friends of the People, in April 1792, which disgusted
him with the forward section of the Whigs; and their
subsequent action completed the breach. Pitt's endeavour to
form a national Administration must have gained a new significance
from the terrible news from Paris. We may be sure,
then, that the youth of twenty-two years gazed with eager
interest on the stately form before him as at the embodiment of
political wisdom, purity, and patriotism.</p>

<p>They shook hands. Then for a time they ambled coyly
around the subject at issue, and talked of "France and Jenkinson,
and other equally important concerns." Indeed Pitt seems to
have been as nervous and awkward as the novice. At length he
plunged into business. "It is your wish, I believe, Mr. Canning
(and I am sure it is mine), to come in, etc." On Canning bowing
assent, Pitt remarked that it was not easy to find an inexpensive
seat, and commented on his expressed desire not to tie himself
to any borough-owner. Whereupon the young aspirant, with
more pride than tact, threw in the remark that he would not
like to be personally beholden to such an one, for instance, as
Lord Lonsdale (who first brought Pitt into Parliament). The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>Prime Minister seemed not to notice the <span lang="fr">gaucherie</span>, and stated
that the Treasury had only six seats at its disposal, but could
arrange matters with "proprietors of burgage-tenures." Thereupon
Canning broke in more deftly. In that case, he said, it
must be made clear that he bound himself to follow, not the
borough-owner, but the Prime Minister. Here he more than
recovered lost ground, if indeed he had lost any. Pitt expressed
his sense of the compliment, and said that this could be managed,
unless the young member came to differ absolutely from
his patron. Canning then frankly confessed his inability to
follow Pitt in maintaining the Test Act. Equally frank and
cordial was the reply, that he (Pitt) did not claim exact agreement,
especially on "speculative subjects," but only "a general
good disposition towards Government," which might be strengthened
by frequent contact.</p>

<p>Such was the course of this memorable interview. It sealed
for ever the allegiance of the youth to his self-chosen leader. He
had prepared Sheridan, and through him Fox and Bouverie, for
this change of front. The openness, the charm, the self-effacing
patriotism of the Minister thenceforth drew him as by an irresistible
magnet. The brilliance and joviality of Fox and Sheridan
counted as nothing against the national impulse which the
master now set in motion and the pupil was destined to carry
to further lengths. There was a natural sympathy between
these men both in aim and temperament. It is a sign of the
greatness of Pitt that from the outset he laid the spell of his
genius irrevocably upon Canning.</p>

<hr />

<p>Deferring to the <a href="#CHAPTER_III">next chapter</a> a study of the democratic
movement in Great Britain, we now turn our attention to the
relations of Pitt to France, a topic which thenceforth dominates
his life story and the destinies of mankind.</p>

<p>In the month of January 1792, there arrived in London an
envoy charged with important proposals from the French Government.
It was Talleyrand, ex-bishop of Autun. Pitt had
become acquainted with him during his residence at Rheims
in the summer of 1783; but the circumstances of the case now
forbade anything more than passing intercourse with that most
charming of talkers and subtlest of diplomatists. Talleyrand,
having been a member of the first, or Constituent, Assembly, was
prevented by the constitution of September 1791 from holding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
any office for two years after that date. Therefore his visit to
London was ostensibly on private affairs. The Duc de Biron
was the envoy, and Talleyrand merely his adviser. He was
instructed to seek "to maintain and strengthen the good understanding
which exists between the two Kingdoms."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>This was only the official pretext for the mission, the secret
aim of which was to win the friendship, if not the alliance, of
England in case of a Franco-Austrian war. In the early days of
January 1792 the constitutional Ministry, holding office, though
not power, at Paris, seemed to be working for a rupture with the
Hapsburgs, partly in order to please the Jacobins, and partly to
escape the ever increasing difficulties of its position. The earlier
causes of dispute do not concern us here. As we have seen, the
Emperor Leopold was far from desirous of war; but the provocative
attitude of the Legislative Assembly at Paris and the
humiliations of his sister, Marie Antoinette, aroused his resentment;
and, early in January, he was heard to say "that if the
French madmen were determined to force him into a war, they
should find that the pacific Leopold knew how to wage it with
the greatest vigour, and would oblige them to pay its expenses
in something more solid than assignats." Our ambassador,
Sir Robert Keith, was, however, convinced that this outburst and
the westward march of troops were but "empty parade."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand Earl Gower, British ambassador at Paris,
reported that the Ministry, the Assembly, and the Jacobins
Club (with the exception of Robespierre and his clique) desired
war.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> In truth, there seemed little risk in a struggle with the
exhausted Hapsburg States, provided that they had support
neither from Prussia nor from England. De S&eacute;gur therefore set
out for Berlin, and Talleyrand for London, to secure the
friendly neutrality or support of those Governments. The latter
envoy was specially suited for his mission, as he carried on the
traditions of Mirabeau, who in the closing months of his life
urged the need of an Anglo-French <span lang="fr">entente</span>.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Talleyrand and Biron reached London on 24th January 1792.
Before reaching the capital they read in the English papers
that they had arrived there, and had been very coldly received by
Pitt&mdash;a specimen of the arts by which the French <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span> in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>London sought to embitter the relations between the two lands.
Talleyrand had the good fortune to occupy a seat in the
Strangers' Gallery at the opening of Parliament close to two
ardent royalists, Cazal&egrave;s and Lally-Tollendal. What must have
been their feelings on hearing in the King's speech the statement
of his friendly relations to the other Powers and his resolve
to reduce the army and navy?</p>

<p>Already Pitt had seen Talleyrand. He reminded him in a
friendly way of their meeting at Rheims, remarked on the
unofficial character of the ex-bishop's "mission," but expressed
his willingness to discuss French affairs, about which he even
showed "curiosity." Grenville afterwards spoke to the envoy in
the same courteous but non-committal manner. Talleyrand was,
however, charmed. He wrote to Delessart, the Foreign Minister
at Paris: "Your best ground is England;&nbsp;... Believe me the
rumours current in France about the disposition of England
towards us are false."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> He urged the need of showing a bold
front; for "it is with a fleet that you must speak to England."</p>

<p>Talleyrand throughout showed the sagacity which earned him
fame in diplomacy. He was not depressed by the King's frigid
reception of him at St. James's on 1st February, or by the
Queen refusing even to notice him. Even the escapades of
Biron did not dash his hopes. That envoy ran up debts and
bargained about horses <span lang="fr">avec un nomm&eacute; Tattersall, qui tient dans
sa main tous les chevaux d'Angleterre</span>, until he was arrested for
debt and immured in a "sponging house," whence the appeals of
the ex-bishop failed to rescue him. As Biron had come with
an official order to buy horses with a view to the impending war
with Austria, we may infer that his arrest was the work of some
keen-witted <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;</span>.</p>

<p>Even this, however, was better than the fortunes of S&eacute;gur,
who found himself openly flouted both by King and courtiers at
Berlin. For Frederick William was still bent on a vigorous
policy. On 7th February his Ministers signed with Prince
Reuss, the Austrian envoy, a secret treaty of defensive alliance,
mainly for the settlement of French affairs, but also with a side
glance at Poland. The Prussian Ministers probably hoped for a
peaceful but profitable settlement, which would leave them free
for a decisive intervention in the Polish troubles now coming to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>a crisis; but Frederick William was in a more warlike mood,
and longed to overthrow the "rebels" in France. S&eacute;gur's
mission to Berlin was therefore an utter failure. That of Talleyrand,
on the other hand, achieved its purpose, mainly because
Pitt and Grenville never had any other desire than to remain
strictly neutral. It was therefore superfluous for Talleyrand to
hint delicately at the desirability of the friendship of France for
England, in view of the war with Tippoo Sahib in India, and the
increasing ferment in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>On 1st March Grenville again assured him of the earnest
desire of the British Government to see the end of the troubles
in France, and declared that Pitt and he had been deeply
wounded by the oft-repeated insinuations that they had sought
to foment them. All such charges were absurd; for "a commercial
people stands only to gain by the freedom of all those who
surround it." We may reasonably conclude that these were the
words of Pitt; for they recall that noble passage of the "Wealth
of Nations": "A nation that would enrich itself by trade is
certainly most likely to do so when its neighbours are all rich,
industrious, and commercial nations."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> For the rest, Grenville
defied the calumniators of England to adduce a single proof in
support of their slanders, and requested Talleyrand to remain
some time in England for the purpose of observing public
opinion. He warned him, however, that the Cabinet could not
give an answer to his main proposal.</p>

<p>More than this Talleyrand could scarcely expect. He had
already divined the important secret that the Cabinet was divided
on this subject, the King, Thurlow, and Camden being hostile
to France, while Pitt, Grenville, and Dundas were friendly.
When Talleyrand ventured to ascribe those sentiments to Pitt
and Grenville, the latter did not deny it, and he at once echoed
the desire expressed by the envoy for the conclusion of an Anglo-French
alliance. That the greater part of the British people
would have welcomed such a compact admits of no doubt. On
the walls were often chalked the words: "No war with the
French." Talleyrand advised the Foreign Minister, Delessart, to
send immediately to London a fully accredited ambassador;
for the talk often was: "We have an ambassador at Paris. Why
have not you one here?" Nevertheless, a despatch of Grenville
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>to Gower, on 9th March, shows that Pitt and he keenly felt the
need of caution. They therefore enjoined complete silence on
Gower. In truth, Grenville's expressions, quoted above, were
merely the outcome of the good will which he and Pitt felt
towards France. But these words from the two powerful Ministers
meant safety for France on her coasts, whatever might betide
her on the Meuse and the Rhine.</p>

<p>On the day when Grenville spoke these words of peace, two
events occurred which portended war. Leopold&nbsp;II died; and
an irritating despatch, which he and Kaunitz had recently sent
to Paris, was read out to the Legislative Assembly. Thereafter
a rupture was inevitable. Francis&nbsp;II, who now ascended
the throne of his father, was a shy, proud, delicate youth of
twenty-four years, having only a superficial knowledge of public
affairs, scarcely known to the Ministers, and endowed with a
narrow pedantic nature which was to be the bane of his people.
He lacked alike the sagacity, the foresight, and the suppleness
of Leopold. Further, though his inexperience should have inspired
him with a dread of war for his storm-tossed States, yet
that same misfortune subjected him to the advice of the veteran
Chancellor, Kaunitz. That crabbed old man advised the maintenance
of a stiff attitude towards France; and this, in her present
temper, entailed war.</p>

<p>The last despatch from Vienna to Paris contained strongly
worded advice to the French Government and Assembly to
adopt a less provocative attitude, to withdraw its troops from
the northern frontier, and, above all, to rid itself of the factious
minority which controlled its counsels. If Leopold had hoped
to intimidate France or to strengthen the peace-party at Paris,
he made the greatest mistake of his reign. The war party at
once gained the ascendancy, decreed the arrest of Delessart for
his tame reply to Vienna, and broke up the constitutional
Ministry. Their successors were mainly Girondins. The most
noteworthy are Roland, who took the Home Office; Clavi&egrave;re,
Finance; and Dumouriez, Foreign Affairs. The last was a man
of great energy and resource. A soldier by training, and with a
dash of the adventurer in his nature, he now leapt to the front,
and astonished France by his zeal and activity. He was not
devoid of prudence; for, as appears from Gower's despatch
of 30th March, he persuaded the Assembly to postpone action
until an answer arrived to his last despatch to Vienna. Gower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
found from conversation with Dumouriez that a rupture must
ensue if a satisfactory reply did not arrive by 15th April.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Four
days later, as no answer came, the Council of Ministers decided
on war; and on the next day Louis formally proposed it to the
Assembly, which assented with acclamation.</p>

<p>Secondary causes helped on the rupture. Frederick William
encouraged the young Emperor to draw the sword, and led him
to expect Alsace and Lorraine as his share of the spoil, the
duchies of J&uuml;lich and Berg falling to Prussia. Catharine also
fanned the crusading zeal at Berlin and Vienna in the hope of
having "more elbow-room," obviously in Poland.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Further, the
news from Madrid and Stockholm indisposed the French Assembly
to endure any dictation from Vienna. At the end of
February Floridablanca fell from power at Madrid, and his successor,
Aranda, showed a peaceful front. And, on 16th March
Gustavus of Sweden was assassinated by Anckarstr&ouml;m, a tool of the
revengeful nobles. This loss was severely felt. The royalist crusade
now had no Tancred, only an uninspiring Duke of Brunswick.</p>

<p>Though France took the final step of declaring war, it is now
known that Austria had done much to provoke it and nothing
to prevent it. The young Emperor refused to withdraw a word
of the provocative despatch; and in his letter to Thugut at
Brussels, he declared he was weary of the state of things in
France and had decided to act and put an end to it; "that he
should march his troops at once, and the French must be amused
for two months until the troops arrived; then, whether the French
attacked him or not, he should attack them."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Keith also wrote
from Vienna to Grenville on 2nd May, that the French declaration
of war had come in the nick of time to furnish the Hapsburgs
with the opportunity of throwing the odium of the war
upon France.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Other proofs might be cited; and it seems certain
that, if France had not thrown down the gauntlet, both the
German Powers would have attacked her in the early summer of
1792. Pitt and Grenville, looking on at these conflicting schemes,
formed the perfectly correct surmise that both sides were bent
on war, and that little or nothing could be done to avert it.</p>

<hr />

<p>We must now trace the policy of Pitt somewhat closely. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>question at issue is, whether he favoured the royalist or the democratic
cause, and was responsible for the ensuing friction between
England and France, which culminated in the long and disastrous
strifes of 1793&ndash;1801.</p>

<p>Dumouriez, as we have seen, threw down the gauntlet to
Austria in the hope of securing the neutrality of Prussia and
the friendship of England. Accordingly he decided to send
Talleyrand on a second mission to London. That skilful diplomat
had recently returned to Paris; and the Foreign Minister
drew up, perhaps in concert with him, a Memoir entitled "Reflections
on a Negotiation with England in case of War," which
provided the text for Talleyrand's discourse to Pitt and Grenville.
The gist of it is that Talleyrand must convince the British
Government of the need of a French attack on the Belgic provinces
of Austria as the sole means of safety. For, while offensive
in appearance, it is in reality defensive. France does not intend
to keep those provinces; and, even if her conquest of them
brings about the collapse of the Stadholder's power in Holland,
England will do well not to intervene in favour of the Orange
<span lang="fr">r&eacute;gime</span>. For what good can the Island Power gain by war with
France? She may take the French colonies; but that will mean
a tiresome struggle with the revolted negroes in the West Indies.
France, meanwhile, with her new-born strength, will conquer
Central Europe and then throw her energy into her fleet. The
better course, then, for England will be to remain neutral, even
if Holland be revolutionized, and the estuary of the Scheldt be
thrown open to all nations. Or, still better, England may help
France to keep in check the King of Prussia and the Prince of
Orange. In that case the two free Powers will march hand in
hand and "become the arbiters of peace or war for the whole
world."</p>

<p>This remarkable pronouncement claims attention for several
reasons. Firstly, it proves that Dumouriez and Talleyrand believed
their sole chance of safety to lie in the conquest of
Austria's Belgic provinces, where a cognate people would receive
them with open arms. That is to say, they desired war with
Austria, and they did not dread the prospect of war with Prussia,
provided that England remained neutral and friendly. Pitt and
Grenville were well aware of this from Gower's despatches. Our
ambassador had warned them that France recked little of a war
with the whole of Europe, provided that England held aloof.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Secondly, this fact disposes of the subsequent charge of Fox
against Pitt, that he ought to have sided with France in 1792
and thereby to have prevented the attack of the German Powers.
For, as we have seen, it was she who took the irrevocable step
of declaring war on Austria; and further, the details given above
prove that all that Frenchmen expected from Pitt was neutrality.
By remaining neutral, while the French overran Belgium, Pitt
was favouring the French plans more than any British statesman
had done since the time of James&nbsp;II. Thirdly, we notice
in the closing sentences of these Reflections signs of that extraordinary
self-confidence which led Girondins and Jacobins to
face without flinching even the prospect of war with England.</p>

<p>What was Pitt's conduct at this crisis? He knew enough
of the politics of Berlin and Vienna to see that those Courts
would almost certainly make war on France. He adopted therefore
the line of conduct which prudence and love of peace
dictated, a strict neutrality. But he refused to proclaim it to
the world, as it would encourage France to attack Austria. At
the same time Grenville let it be known that Austria must not
be deprived of her Belgic lands, which England had assured to
her, firstly by the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), and quite recently
by the Reichenbach Convention. As Grenville phrased it&mdash;"The
Pays Bas form the chain which unites England to the
Continent, and the central knot of our relations to Austria and
Russia. It would be broken if they belonged to France."
Talleyrand and Dumouriez knew this perfectly well, and prudently
declared that France had no intention of keeping those
lands. Would that the Jacobins and Napoleon had shown the
same wise self-restraint! It was their resolve to dominate the
Netherlands which brought them into irreconcilable opposition
to Pitt and his successors down to the year 1814.</p>

<p>Statesmanlike though the aims of Dumouriez were, they suffered
not a little in their exposition. Talleyrand, the brain of
the policy, was not its mouthpiece. In the French embassy at
Portman Square he figured merely as adviser to the French
ambassador, the <span lang="fr">ci-devant</span> Marquis de Chauvelin, a vain and
showy young man, devoid of the qualities of insight, tact, and
patience in which the ex-bishop of Autun excelled his contemporaries.
Had this sage counsellor remained in London to
the end of the year, things might have gone very differently.
The instructions issued to Chauvelin contain ideas similar to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
those outlined above; but they lay stress on the utility of a
French alliance for England, in order to thwart the aims of a
greedy Coalition and to ensure her own internal tranquillity,
which, it is hinted, France can easily ruffle. Talleyrand is also
charged to offer to cede the small but valuable island, Tobago,
which we lost in 1783, provided that the British Government
guaranteed a French loan of &pound;3,000,000 or &pound;4,000,000, to be
raised in London; and he is to suggest that, if the two Powers
acted together, they could revolutionize Spanish America and
control the world.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Our curiosity is aroused as to the reception which Pitt and
Grenville gave to these schemes. It is not certain, however, that
Chauvelin and Talleyrand showed their hand completely; for
events told against them from the outset. Chauvelin bore with
him an autograph letter from Louis&nbsp;XVI to George&nbsp;III, couched
in the friendliest terms, and expressing the hope of closer relations
between the two peoples.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> But before he could present it
to the King at St. James's, it appeared in the Paris papers.
This breach of etiquette created a bad impression; for it seemed
that the letter was merely a bid for an alliance between the two
peoples. It is quite possible that Dumouriez, with his natural
impulsiveness, allowed it to gain currency in order to identify
Louis&nbsp;XVI with French democracy, and that in its turn with
public opinion in England. Further, we now know that Marie
Antoinette, in her resolve to paralyse the policy and the defensive
power of France, wrote at once to Fersen at Brussels
that her consort's letter was very far from speaking his real
sentiments.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> This news, when passed on to London, must have
made it clear that the two envoys represented the Girondin
Ministry, but not the King of France. Then again tidings soon
arrived of the disgraceful flight of the French troops on the
Belgian frontier, the new levies, at sight of the Austrian horse,
rushing back to Lille in wild disorder and there murdering their
General, Theobald Dillon. George&nbsp;III and Grenville wrote of
this event in terms of disgust and contempt.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> It is therefore not
surprising that the reception of Chauvelin was far from promising;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and Talleyrand doubtless felt that the time was not ripe
for discussing an Anglo-French <span lang="fr">entente</span> for the control of the
world.</p>

<p>In fact, the envoys were received coolly from the outset. The
outbreak of war on the Continent had caused almost a panic in
the City. The Funds dropped sharply, and Pitt ordered an
official denial to sinister reports of a forthcoming raid by the
press-gang. A little later he assured a deputation of merchants
that England would hold strictly aloof from the war. Chauvelin
reported these facts to his Government along with the assurance
that the Cabinet had definitely resolved on neutrality. How he
came to know of that decision is a mystery; and it is scarcely
less odd that a copy of his despatch reporting it should be in
the Pitt Papers.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> On the whole, then, France had good reason
to be satisfied with Pitt. Austria, on the other hand, disliked
his conduct. Kaunitz, with his usual acerbity, gave out that
England was secretly hostile to the House of Hapsburg; and
Keith, finding his position increasingly awkward, begged for
his recall.</p>

<p>The first sign of friction between England and France arose
out of the King's proclamation against seditious writings, which
we noticed in the <a href="#CHAPTER_I">last chapter</a>. Chauvelin complained of some
of its phrases, and stated that France waged war for national
safety, not for aggrandizement. Grenville thereupon loftily remarked
that Chauvelin had no right to express an opinion on a
question which concerned solely the King's Government and
Parliament. The British reply irritated by its curt correctness.</p>

<p>Equally unfortunate were some incidents in the ensuing debates
on this topic. Some members emphasized their loyalty by adverting
tartly to the connections of Thomas Paine and English
reformers with the French Jacobins. On 31st May the Duke of
Richmond charged that writer with being an emissary from
abroad, because he had advised the destruction of the British
navy.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> There is no such passage in the "Rights of Man"; and
the Duke must have read with the distorting lens of fear or
hatred the suggestion that, if England, France, and the United
States were allied, a very small navy would be needed, costing
not more than half a million a year.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> But this incident is typical
of the prejudice that was growing against France. Grenville in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>the same debate declared that the Corresponding Societies
avowed their connection with foreign clubs and were engaged in
circulating pamphlets. The conclusion was obvious, that close
relations with France must be avoided. As to the feeling of the
Royal Family, it was manifested in an effusively loyal speech
by the Prince of Wales, his first speech at Westminster. In it he
marked his entire severance from Fox on this question.</p>

<p>Grenville's complaisance to the French envoys was perhaps
little more than a blind to mask his contempt for them and their
principles. On 19th June he wrote to Auckland respecting the
"ignorance and absurdity of the French mission," but suggested
that the picking a quarrel with France would only help the
English Jacobins to introduce French notions. Even if this
mission were got rid of, some one else might come who might
make even more mischief. These expressions refer to the connections
which Chauvelin and Talleyrand had formed with the
Opposition. As Bland Burges remarked: "Talleyrand is intimate
with Paine, Home Tooke, Lord Lansdowne, and a few more of
that stamp, and is generally scouted by every one else."
George&nbsp;III's words were equally contemptuous and marked his
resolve to have as little as possible to do with France.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Pitt did
not state his opinions on this topic; but he probably held those
of Grenville.</p>

<p>The prejudices of the King and the resolves of the two chief
Ministers proved fatal to an ardent appeal which came from
Paris in the middle of June. As the attitude of the Court of
Berlin became more and more warlike, Dumouriez put forth
one more effort to gain the friendly mediation of England and
thus assure peace with Prussia. Chauvelin, swallowing his annoyance
at Grenville's recent note, pointed out that Austria was
making great efforts to induce Prussia, Holland, and the lesser
German States to join her in the war against liberty. The designs
of the monarchs against Poland were notorious; and it was clear
that a vast conspiracy was being hatched against the free States
of the Continent. Would not England, then, endeavour to stop
the formation of this reactionary league?</p>

<p>The occasion was, indeed, highly important. It is conceivable
that, if British influence had been powerful at Berlin, a spirited
declaration would have had some effect at that Court. Unfortunately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
our influence had sunk to zero since the Oczakoff fiasco
of 1791. Moreover, the Prussian Government had by that time
decided to break with France. Her envoys were dismissed from
Berlin in the first week of June, and it is probable that Pitt and
Grenville by 18th June knew of the warlike resolve of the Prussian
Government. In any case, after a delay of twenty days,
they sent once more a reply to Chauvelin's request, affirming the
earnest desire of His Majesty to contribute to the restoration of
peace, but re-asserting his decision in favour of unswerving
neutrality. On 24th July Prussia declared war against France,
and three days later the Duke of Brunswick issued the famous
manifesto to the French people which thrilled the French
people with indignation against the hapless sovereigns at the
Tuileries whom it was designed to protect.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>The outbreak of war on the Rhine and Meuse was an event
of incalculable importance. As we have seen, Pitt discouraged
the bellicose tendencies of the <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span> and of the Austrian and
Prussian Courts. But the passions of the time ran too high to
admit of the continuance of peace; and State after State was
soon to be drawn into the devouring vortex of strife. Strange to
say the first to suffer from the outbreak of hostilities was Poland.
That Republic entered on a new lease of life in the spring of
the year 1791. The constitution adopted with enthusiasm on
3rd May substituted an hereditary for an elective monarchy,
and otherwise strengthened the fabric of that almost anarchic
State. Social and civic reforms promised also to call its burghers
and serfs to a life of activity or comfort. But the change at
once aroused keen dislike at St. Petersburg and Berlin. Prussian
statesmen resented any improvement in the condition of their
nominal ally, and declared that, if Russia gained a strong position
on the Euxine, Prussia and Austria must secure indemnities
at the expense of Poland.</p>

<p>The Czarina soon succeeded in heading them in that direction.
After the signature of the Peace of Jassy with the Turks
early in January 1792, she began openly to encourage the
factious efforts of Polish malcontents. The troubles at Paris
also enabled her to engage the Courts of Vienna and Berlin
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>in a western crusade on which she bestowed her richest blessing,
her own inmost desires meanwhile finding expression
in the following confidential utterance: "I am breaking my head
to make the Cabinets of Vienna and Berlin intervene in the
affairs of France. I wish to see them plunged into some very
complicated question in order to have my own hands free."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Though her old opponent, Kaunitz, fathomed her intentions,
she partly succeeded in persuading the Austrian and Prussian
Ministers that their mission clearly was to stamp out Jacobinism
at Paris, while Providence reserved for her the duty of extirpating
its offshoots at Warsaw. In the Viennese Court, where the
value of a regenerated Poland as a buffer State was duly appreciated,
there were some qualms as to the spoliation of that unoffending
State; but Prussian politicians, in their eagerness for
the Polish districts, Danzig and Thorn, harboured few scruples
as to betraying the cause of their allies at Warsaw.</p>

<p>Little by little the outlines of a scheme were sketched between
Austria and Prussia for securing indemnities for the expenses
of the war against France; and it was arranged that Prussia
should acquire the coveted lands on the lower Vistula; also
Anspach and Baireuth; Austria was to effect the long-desired
Belgic-Bavarian exchange, besides gaining parts of Alsace; and
it was understood that Russia would annex the Polish Ukraine
and work her will in the rest of Poland. The Polish part of the
scheme was, however, stiffly opposed by Kaunitz; and in the
sequel the old Chancellor ended his long and distinguished career
by way of protest against a change of front which he deemed
unwise and disgraceful.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Early in May everything was ready for the restoration of
anarchy in Poland. Catharine ordered her troops to enter its
borders; and the factious Polish nobles whom she had sheltered
during the winter returned to their land and formed a "Confederation"
at Targowicz on 14th May for the purpose of undoing
the reforms of 1791. Daniel Hailes, our envoy at Warsaw, kept
Grenville fully informed of this affair. On 16th June he reported
Austria's desertion of Poland, the brutal refusal of the Court of
Berlin to accord help to its ally, the heroic efforts of Kosciusko
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>and the Polish levies to resist the Russian armies, and the despair
of the patriots of Warsaw, adding the cynical comment that at
Warsaw patriotism was only a cloak for private interest, and that
the new constitution was generally regarded as the death-blow
to Polish independence.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Whether he added these words to
please Grenville, who had always discouraged the Polish cause,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
is not easy to say; but the statement cannot be reconciled with
Hailes's earlier enthusiasm for that well-meant effort.</p>

<p>On all sides the Polish patriots now found indifference or
hostility. The Elector of Saxony (their King-elect) gave them
cold words; and Catharine demanded the restoration of the old
constitution of which she was a guarantor. King Stanislaus, a
prey to deep despondency, saw the defence collapse on all sides,
and at the close of June the Russians drew near to Warsaw.
Many of the Polish reformers fled to Leipzig and there prepared
to appeal to Europe against this forcible suppression of a truly
national constitution.</p>

<p>Amidst these scenes Hailes was replaced by Colonel Gardiner,
who received from Grenville the following instructions, dated
4th August 1792. He informed him that Hailes had last year
been charged "to confine himself to such assurances of His
Majesty's good wishes as could be given without committing
H.M. to any particular line of conduct with respect to any
troubles that might arise on the subject [of the Polish Revolution].
The event has unhappily but too well justified their
reserve; and the present situation is such as to leave little hope
that the tranquillity of that unfortunate land can be restored
without its falling again into the most entire dependence on the
power of Russia, even if no further dismemberment of territory
should take place." Grenville then stated that Prussia's conduct
was due to fear of a strong Government in Poland; but the
present alternative (a Russian occupation) would probably be
worse for her. He added these sentences: "No intervention of
the Maritime Powers [England and Holland] could be serviceable
to Poland, at least not without a much greater exertion and
expense than the importance to their separate interests could
possibly justify.... You are to be very careful not to do anything
which could hold out ill-grounded expectations of support
from this country."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
<p>In these words Grenville passed sentence of death upon
Poland. On this important subject he must have acted with
the consent of Pitt; but the opinion of the latter is unknown.
It would seem that after the weak treatment of the Oczakoff
crisis by Parliament, he gave up all hope of saving either
Turkey or Poland. If that was impracticable in the spring of
1791, how much more so in August 1792, when French affairs
claimed far closer attention? It is worth noticing that several
of the Foxites (not Fox himself, for he was still intent on a
Russian alliance),<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> now revised their opinion about Catharine&nbsp;II
and inveighed against her for trampling on the liberties of
Poland. Did they now discover the folly of their conduct in
previously encouraging her?</p>

<p>In despair of help from England, some of the patriots of
Warsaw turned towards France. But this added to their misfortunes.
It gave the schemers of Berlin the longed-for excuse
of intervening by force under the pretext that they must stamp
out "the French evil" from States bordering on their own. On
hearing of the advance of three Prussian columns, Catharine
threw her whole weight into Polish affairs.</p>

<p>So closely did the fortunes of Poland intertwine themselves
with those of France. The outbreak of the Franco-Austrian
war meant ruin for the reformers at Warsaw. Had Austria held
to her former resolve, to prevent the triumph of Russia or
Prussia in Poland, it is possible that Pitt and Grenville would
have decided to support her. As it was, they maintained their
cautious and timid neutrality. The reports of Hailes were
explicit enough to show that another partition was at hand;
but, so far as I can discover, they lifted not a finger to prevent
it. The excess of Pitt's caution at this crisis enables us to
gauge the magnitude of the disaster to the Polish cause involved
by his surrender to the Czarina in the spring and summer of
1791. By a wonderful display of skill and audacity she emerged
triumphant from all her difficulties, and now, while egging on
the German Powers to war with France, planted her heel on the
liberties of Poland. Her conquest was easy and profitable. The
restoration of order at Paris proved to be fraught with unexpected
dangers, and the German sovereigns scarcely set their hands to
the task before they discovered that they were her dupes. If
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>the French war worked disaster at Warsaw, the prospect of a
partition of Poland undoubtedly helped to lessen the pressure
on France during the campaign of Valmy. Hope of further
spoils in 1794&ndash;5 distracted the aims of the Allies; and Pitt was
destined to see the efforts of the monarchical league in the West
weaken and die away under the magnetic influence of the eastern
problem. Well would it have been for him if he could have upheld
Poland in 1791. By so doing he would have removed the
cause of bitter dissensions between the Houses of Romanoff,
Hapsburg, and Hohenzollern. As will appear in due course,
Revolutionary France achieved her marvellous triumphs partly
by the prowess of her sons, but still more owing to the intrigues
and feuds which clogged the efforts of the Allies and baffled the
constructive powers of Pitt.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="title spaced">PEACE OR WAR?</p>

<p class="quote">It seems absolutely impossible to hesitate as to supporting our Ally
[Holland] in case of necessity, and the explicit declaration of our sentiments
is the most likely way to prevent the case occurring.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pitt to Lord
Stafford</span>, <i>13th November 1792</i>.</p>


<p>One of the first requisites for the study of a period whose
outlines are well known, is to bar out the insidious notion
that the course of events was inevitable. Nine persons out of ten
have recourse to that easy but fallacious way of explaining
events. The whole war, they say, or think, was inevitable. It
was fated that the Duke of Brunswick should issue his threatening
manifesto to the Parisians if violence were offered to Louis&nbsp;XVI;
that they should resent the threat, rise in revolt, and dethrone
the King, and thereafter massacre royalists in the prisons. The
innate vigour of the democratic cause further required that the
French should stand their ground at Valmy and win a pitched
battle at Jemappes, that victory leading to an exaltation of soul
in which the French Republicans pushed on their claims in such
a way as to bring England into the field. History, when written
in this way, is a symmetrical mosaic; and the human mind loves
patterns.</p>

<p>But events are not neatly chiselled; they do not fall into
geometrical groups, however much the memory, for its own ease,
seeks to arrange them thus. Their edges are jagged; and the
slightest jar might have sent them in different ways. To recur
to the events in question: the Duke of Brunswick objected to
issuing the manifesto, and only owing to the weariness or weakness
of old age, yielded to the insistence of the <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span> at his
headquarters: the insurrection at Paris came about doubtfully
and fitfully; the issue on 10th August hung mainly on the
personal bearing of the King; the massacres were the work of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
an insignificant minority, which the vast mass regarded with
sheer stupefaction; and even the proclamation of the French
Republic by the National Convention on 21st September was
not without many searchings of heart.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Pitt and Grenville had not the slightest inkling as
to the trend of events. The latter on 13th July 1792 wrote thus
to Earl Gower at Paris: "My speculations are that the first
entrance of the foreign troops [into France] will be followed by
negotiations; but how they are to end, or what possibility there
is to establish any form of government, or any order in France,
is far beyond any conjectures I can form."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> This uncertainty
is illuminating. It shows that Pitt and Grenville were not farseeing
schemers bent on undermining the liberties of France
and Britain by a war on which they had long resolved, but
fallible mortals, unable to see a handbreadth through the turmoil,
but cherishing the hope that somehow all would soon
become clear. As to British policy during the summer of 1792,
it may be classed as masterly inactivity or nervous passivity,
according to the standpoint of the critic. In one case alone did
Pitt and Grenville take a step displeasing to the French Government,
namely, by recalling Gower from the embassy at Paris;
and this was due to the fall of the French monarchy on 10th
August, and to the danger attending the residence of a noble in
Paris. Only by a display of firmness did Gower and his secretary,
Lindsay, succeed in obtaining passports from the new Foreign
Minister, Lebrun.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>That follower of Dumouriez had as colleagues the former
Girondin Ministers, Clavi&egrave;re, Roland, and Servan. Besides them
were Monge (the physicist) for the Navy, and Danton for Justice,
the latter a far from reassuring choice, as he was known to be
largely responsible for the massacres in the prisons of Paris
early in September. Little is known about the publicist, Lebrun,
on whom now rested the duty of negotiating with England,
Spain, Holland, etc. It is one of the astonishing facts of this
time that unknown men leaped to the front at Paris, directed
affairs to momentous issues, and then sank into obscurity or
perished. The Genevese Clavi&egrave;re started assignats and managed
revolutionary finance; Servan controlled the War Office for some
months with much ability, and then fell; P&eacute;tion, Santerre, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>popular Paris brewer, and an ex-hawker, Hanriot, were successively
rulers of Paris for a brief space.</p>

<p>But of all the puzzles of this time Lebrun is perhaps the chief.
In his thirtieth year he was Foreign Minister of France, when
she broke with England, Holland, Spain, and the Empire. He
is believed by many (<span lang="la">e.g.</span>, by W. A. Miles, who knew him well)
to be largely responsible for those wars. Yet who was this
Lebrun? Before the Revolution he had to leave France for his
advanced opinions, and took refuge at Li&eacute;ge, where Miles found
him toiling for a scanty pittance at journalistic hack-work.
Suffering much at the hands of the Austrians in 1790, he fled
back to Paris, joined the Girondins, wrote for them, made himself
useful to Dumouriez during his tenure of the Foreign Office,
and, not long after his resignation, stepped into his shoes and
appropriated his policy. In order to finish with him here, we
may note that he voted for the death of Louis&nbsp;XVI, and, as
President of the Executive Council at that time, signed the
order for the execution. He and other Girondins were driven
from power on 2nd June 1793 (when Hanriot's brazen voice
decided the fate of the Girondins) and he was guillotined on
23rd December of that year, for the alleged crime of conspiring to
place Philippe Egalit&eacute; on the throne. Mme. Roland, who helped
Lebrun to rise to power, limns his portrait in these sharp outlines:
"He passed for a wise man, because he showed no kind
of <span lang="fr">&eacute;lan</span>; and for a clever man, because he was a fairly good
clerk; but he possessed neither activity, intellect, nor force of
character." The want of <span lang="fr">&eacute;lan</span> seems to be a term relative merely
to the characteristics of the Girondins, who, whatever they lacked,
had that Gallic quality in rich measure.</p>

<p>Chauvelin, the French ambassador in London, is another of
these revolutionary rockets. Only in fiction and the drama does
he stand forth at all clearly to the eye. History knows him
not, except that he had been a marquis, then took up with the
Girondins, finally shot up among the Jacobins and made much
noise by his intrigues and despatches. With all his showiness
and vanity he had enough shrewdness to suit his language at
the French embassy in Portman Square to the Jacobin jargon
of the times. After the September massacres the only hope for
an aristocratic envoy was to figure as an irreproachable patriot.
Chauvelin's dealings with the English malcontents therefore became
more and more pronounced; for indeed they served both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
as a life insurance and as a means of annoying Pitt and Grenville
in return for their refusal to recognize him as the ambassador
of the new Republic. Londoners in general sided with the
Ministry and snubbed the French envoys. Dumont describes
their annoyance, during a visit to Ranelagh, at being received
everywhere with the audible whisper, "Here comes the French
embassy"; whereupon faces were turned away and a wide space
was left around them.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Such, then, were the men on whom largely rested the future
of Europe. Lebrun mistook fussiness for activity. At a time
when tact and dignity prescribed a diminution of the staff at
Portman Square, he sent two almost untried men, No&euml;l and, a
little later, Beno&icirc;t, to help Chauvelin to mark time. Talleyrand
also gained permission to return to London as <i>adjoint</i>
to Chauvelin, which, it appears, was the only safe means of
escaping from Paris. Chauvelin speedily quarrelled with him.
But the doings of the French embassy concern us little for the
present, as Pitt and Grenville paid no attention to the offers,
similar to those made in April, which Lebrun charged his envoys
to make for an Anglo-French alliance. It is not surprising,
after the September massacres, that Ministers should
hold sternly aloof from the French envoys; but we may note
that Miles considered their attitude most unwise. He further
remarked that the proud reserve of Grenville was almost offensive.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
We made the acquaintance of Miles as British agent
at Paris in 1790 and noted his consequential airs. In 1792 they
were full blown.</p>

<p>The opinions of George&nbsp;III and Pitt on the events of that
bloody harvest-time in Paris are very little known. The King's
letters from Weymouth to Pitt in August&ndash;September are few
and brief. On 16th September, after the arrival of news of
the massacres, he writes to say that his decision respecting the
Prince of Wales's debts is irrevocable. After that there is a long
silence. Pitt's reserve is equally impenetrable. We know, however,
from the letters of Burke that the conduct of Ministers
deeply disappointed him. Writing to Grenville on 19th September
he says that the crisis exceeds in gravity any that is
recorded in history; and he adds these curious words: "I know
it is the opinion of His Majesty's Ministers that the new [French]
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>principles may be encouraged, and even triumph over every interior
and exterior resistance, and may even overturn other States
as they have that of France, without any sort of danger of their
extending in their consequences to this Kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Can we
have a clearer testimony to the calm but rigid resolve with
which Pitt and his colleague clung to neutrality? On the following
day (the day of the Battle of Valmy) Pitt frigidly
declined the request of the Austrian and Neapolitan ambassadors,
that the British Government would exclude from its
territories all those who should be guilty of an attack on the
French royal family. On 21st September Grenville issued a
guarded statement on this subject to the <span lang="fr">corps diplomatique</span>; but
it was far from meeting the desires of the royalists.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>Reticence is a virtue over-developed in an aristocracy&mdash;"that
austere domination," as Burke terms it. The virtue is slow in
taking root among democracies. The early Radical clubs of
Great Britain regarded it as their cherished privilege to
state their opinions on foreign affairs with Athenian loquacity;
and the months of October and November 1792, when we
vainly seek to know the inner feelings of Pitt, are enlivened by
resolutions expressing joy at the downfall of tyrants, and fervent
beliefs in the advent of a fraternal millennium, the first fruits of
which were the election of Paine as deputy for Calais to the
National Convention.</p>

<p>In the dealings of nations, as of individuals, feelings often
count for more than interests. This was the case in the last four
months of the year 1792, when the subjects in dispute bulked
small in comparison with the passions and prejudices which
magnified and distorted them. The psychology of the time
therefore demands no less attention than its diplomacy. Its first
weeks were darkened by news of the September massacres.
Even now the details of that cowardly crime arouse horror: and
surely no part of Carlyle's epic sinks so low as that in which
he seeks to compare that loathsome butchery with the bloodshed
of a battlefield.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> No such special pleading was attempted
by leaders of thought of that period. On 10th September
Romilly, a friend of human progress, wrote to Dumont:
"How could we ever be so deceived in the character of the
French nation as to think them capable of liberty?... One
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>might as well think of establishing a republic of tigers in some
forest of Africa." To which the collaborator of Mirabeau replied:
"Let us burn all our books; let us cease to think and
dream of the best system of legislation, since men make so diabolical
a use of every truth and every principle."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> These feelings
were general among Frenchmen. Buzot stated that the loss of
morality, with all its attendant evils, dated from the September
massacres.</p>

<p>It seems strange that the democratic cause made headway in
England after this fell event. Probably its details were but
dimly known to the poor, who were at this time the victims
of a bad harvest and severe dearth. The months of September
and October were marked by heavy and persistent rains. The
Marquis of Buckingham on 23rd September wrote at Stowe to
his brother, Lord Grenville, that he was living amidst a vortex of
mud, clay, and water such as was never known before&mdash;the result
of six weeks of unsettled weather, which must impair the harvest
and increase the difficulty of maintaining order.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Certainly the
stars in their courses fought against the <span lang="fr">ancien r&eacute;gime</span>. The
rains which made a receptive seed-bed for the writings of Paine
also hampered the progress of Brunswick towards the Argonne,
crowded his hospitals with invalids, and in part induced that
inglorious retreat. As the storms lasted far into the autumn,
disaffection increased apace.</p>

<p>The results serve to enliven the dull tones of our Home Office
archives. There one reads of bread riots and meal riots so far
back as May 1792, in which stalls are overturned and despoiled;
also of more persistent agitation in the factory towns of the
North. Liverpool leads off with a dock-strike that is with difficulty
ended. Then the colliers of Wigan stop work and seek to
persuade all their comrades to follow their example. Most
threatening of all is the situation at Manchester and Sheffield.
There, in addition to disorder among the townsfolk, disaffection
gains ground among the troops sent to keep order. This again
is traceable to the dearness of food, for which the scanty pay of
the trooper by no means suffices. Here, then, is the opportunity
for the apostle of discontent judiciously to offer a cheap edition
of the "Rights of Man," on which fare the troop becomes half-mutinous
and sends in a petition for higher pay. This the perplexed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
authorities do not grant, but build barracks, a proceeding
eyed askance by publicans and patriots as the beginning
of military rule.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The South of England, too, is beset by fears of a novel kind.
After the overthrow of the French monarchy on 10th August
fugitives from France come fast to the coasts of Kent and
Sussex. The flights become thicker day by day up to the end
of that fell month of September. Orthodox priests, always in
disguise, form the bulk of the new arrivals. As many as 700
of them land at Eastbourne, and strain the hospitality of that
little town. About as many reach Portsmouth and Gosport, to
the perplexity of the authorities. When assured that they are
staunch royalists and not apostles of Revolution, the commander
allots shelter in the barracks at Forton, where for the
present they exist on two pence a day each. Plymouth, which
receives fewer of them, frowns on the newcomers as politically
suspect and economically ruinous. The mayor assures Dundas
that, if more priests arrive, or are sent there, they will be driven
away by the townsfolk for fear of dearth of corn. In Jersey the
food question eclipses all others; for 2,000 priests (so it is said)
land there, until all ideas of hospitality are cast to the winds and
the refugees are threatened with expulsion. Only in the vast obscurantism
of London is there safety for these exiles. A subscription
list is started on their behalf; the King offers the royal
house at Winchester for the overplus at Portsmouth: and by
degrees the scared throngs huddle down into the dire poverty
and uneasy rest that are to be their lot for many a year.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Strange adventures befell many of the French nobles in their
escape. The Duc de Liancourt, commanding the troops at
Rouen, was fain to flee to the coast, hire a deckless craft, and
conceal himself under faggots. In that manner he put to sea
and finally made the opposite coast at Hastings. There, still
nervous, he made his way to the nearest inn, and, to proclaim his
insularity, called for porter. The beverage was too much for
him, and he retired to his room in a state of unconscious
passivity. On his awaking, the strange surroundings seemed
those of a French lock-up; but as he crept down to make his
escape, the mugs caught his eye; and their brightness convinced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
him that he was in England. Such was his story, told to
the family at Bury, where Fanny Burney was staying. Several
of the wealthier French refugees settled at Richmond, and there
found Horace Walpole as charmer and friend. But the most
distinguished group was that at Juniper Hall, near Dorking
where finally Mme. de Sta&euml;l and Talleyrand enlivened the dull
days and long drives with unfailing stores of wit. We shall later
on make the acquaintance of the French <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span> in a more
active and bellicose mood.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the mental condition of our folk. Depressed
by rain and dear food, beset by stories of plotters from Paris, or
harrowed by the tales of misery of the French <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span>, Britons
came to look on France as a land peopled by demons, who
sought to involve other lands in the ruin to which they had
reduced their own. In this state of nervousness and excitement
little was needed to bring about a furious reaction on behalf of
Church and King.</p>

<p>The follies of English democrats helped on this reaction.
Whispers went about of strange and threatening orders of arms
at Birmingham. A correspondent at the midland capital informed
Dundas at the end of September that a Dr. Maxwell, of
York, had ordered 20,000 daggers, which were to be 12 inches
in the blade and 5&nbsp;1/4 inches in the handle. The informant convinced
the manufacturer that he must apprise the Home Secretary
of this order and send him a specimen of the weapon.
Probably it was the same which Burke melodramatically cast
down on the floor of the House of Commons during his speech
of 28th December. The dimensions exactly tally with those
named by the biographer of Lord Eldon, who retained that
dagger, though Bland Burges also put in a claim to have
possessed it. The scepticism which one feels about this prodigious
order of daggers, which others give as 3,000, is somewhat
lessened by finding another letter, of 2nd October 1792,
addressed to Dundas by James Maxwell of York, who stated
that he highly disapproved of the "French" opinions of his
younger brother (specimens of whose letters he enclosed), and
had just given him &pound;500 so as to dissuade him from going to
Manchester to stir up discontent there.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> This unbrotherly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>conduct condemns the elder Maxwell, but his information to
some extent corroborated that which came from Birmingham.
The whole affair may have been merely a device to frighten
Ministers; but report says that Pitt took it seriously and ascribed
to him the singular statement that Ministers soon might
not have a hand to act with or a tongue to speak with.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Certainly there was a good deal of discontent in the manufacturing
towns, but it is not easy to say whether it resulted
more from dear food or from political reasons. At Stockport a
new club styled "The Friends of universal Peace and the
Rights of Man," issued and circulated a manifesto asserting their
right to inquire into political affairs:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>It is our labour that supports monarchy, aristocracy, and the priesthood....
We are not the "swinish multitude" that Mr. Burke speaks
of. A majority of the House of Commons is returned by less than
6,000 voters; whereas, if the representation were equal (and we sincerely
hope that it shortly will be), nearly that number will elect every
single member. Not one-twentieth part of the commoners of Great
Britain are electors.... We have a National Debt of more than
&pound;270,000,000, and pay &pound;17,000,000 a year in taxes. More than one
fourth of our incomes goes in taxes.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>
</div>


<p>The Radical clubs also showed a desire to pry into foreign
affairs; witness the following letter from Thomas Hardy to
Dr. Adams, Secretary of the London Society for Constitutional
Information:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">No. 9 Piccadilly (London), <i>Sept. 21 1792</i>.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The London Corresponding Society having taken the resolution of
transmitting to the French National Convention an address&nbsp;... to
assure that suffering nation that we sympathize with them in their misfortunes;
that we view their exertions with admiration; that we wish to
give them all such contenance [<span lang="la">sic</span>] and support as individuals unsupported
and oppressed themselves can afford; and that, should those in
power here dare (in violation of the nation's pledged faith of neutrality
and in opposition to the well-known sentiments of the people at large)
to join the German band of despots united against Liberty, we disclaim
all concurrence therein, and will to a man exert every justifiable means
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>for counteracting their machinations against the freedom and happiness
of mankind.</p>

<p>I am ordered by the Committee to acquaint the Society for Constitutional
Information therewith, in order to be favoured with their opinions
thereon, and in hopes that, if they approve the idea and recommend its
adoption to the different societies, the publication of such a respectable
number of <em>real</em> names will greatly check the hostile measures which
might otherwise be put in execution.</p>
</div>


<p>On 5th October the Society for Constitutional Information
agreed to the plan, and ordered the drafting of a joint address to
the French Convention. By this time the news of the successful
stand of the French troops against the Allies at Valmy and
the subsequent retreat of the latter greatly encouraged the English
democrats; and a more militant tone appears in their
addresses. Thus in that meeting of 5th October a letter was
read from Joel Barlow containing these sentences: "A great
Revolution in the management of the affairs of nations is doubtless
soon to be expected through all Europe; and in the progress
of mankind towards this attainment it is greatly to be
desired that the convictions to be acquired from rational discussion
should precede and preclude those which must result from
physical exertion."</p>

<p>Why "precede and preclude"? The two expressions are incompatible.
It seems that some more moderate member must
have added the latter word as a sop to the authorities. In any
case the last words of the sentence were clearly intended as a
threat. On 26th October, John Frost being in the chair, the
same Society framed the following resolution:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>That the Secretary do procure correct copies of the Manifesto published
by the late General Burgoyne while in America, of the first
Manifesto lately published by the Duke of Brunswick in France, of the
last Royal Proclamation against writings and meetings in England, and
of the Emperor's recent proclamation at Brussels on the same subject;
in order that these four pieces may be printed fairly together on one
sheet of paper, and be transmitted by this Society to all the associated
Societies in Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>
</div>


<p>It was then resolved to publish this resolution in the "Argus,"
"Morning Chronicle,"<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> "Star," "Morning Post," "English
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>Chronicle," "World," and "Courier." These papers supported
the democratic cause. In order to counteract their influence Pitt
and his colleagues about this time helped to start two newspapers,
"The Sun" and "The True Briton," the advent of which
was much resented by Mr. Walter of "The Times," after his
support of the Government.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Apparently these papers were of a
more popular type, and heralded the advent of a cheap and
sensational royalism. Sheridan wittily advised that the motto of
"The Sun" should be, not merely the beginning, but the whole
of the passage:</p>


<p class="poem"><span lang="la" style="font-style: normal">
<span class="i14" style="font-style: normal">Solem quis dicere falsum<br /></span>
Audeat? Ille etiam caecos instare tumultus<br />
Saepe monet, fraudemque, et operta tumescere bella.</span><a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
</p>


<p>The combined address from several patriotic (<span lang="la">i.e.</span> reform)
societies, arranged for by Thomas Hardy, was not read at the
bar of the French Convention until 7th November. It set forth
that the five thousand signatories indignantly stepped forth to
rescue their country from the opprobrium thrown upon it by the
base conduct of the Government. In vain did Ministers seek to
overawe the timid and mislead the credulous: for Knowledge
and Reason were making great strides in England, so that
Britons now looked on Frenchmen only as "citizens of the
world, children of the common Father," not as enemies to be
assassinated "at the command of weak or ambitious Kings, or
of corrupt Ministers." Their real enemies were the destructive
aristocracy, "the bane of all the countries of the earth. You
have acted wisely in banishing it from France." They (the
signatories) could not take up arms to help France, because the
Government had pledged the national faith that it would remain
neutral. The Elector of Hanover had joined his troops to those
of traitors and robbers; "but the King of England will do well
to remember that England is not Hanover; should he forget
this, we will not forget it.... We ardently wish a Triple Alliance,
not of crowned heads, but of the people of America,
France, and Great Britain will give liberty to Europe and peace
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>to the world." The address was signed by Margarot and Hardy.
It and other addresses were reported verbatim by our <span lang="fr">charg&eacute;
d'affaires</span>, Munro, to the Foreign Office.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>The democratic ferment in England speedily aroused a decided
opposition. Macaulay probably does not much exaggerate when
he says that out of twenty well-to-do persons nineteen were
ardently loyal and firmly anti-Jacobin. The month of November
saw the formation of an "Ante [<span lang="la">sic</span>]-Levelling Society, for
supporting the Civil Power in suppressing Tumults and maintaining
the constitutional Government of this Country in King,
Lords, and Commons." Its programme leaves much to be
desired in the matter of style, but nothing in respect to loyalty.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
The club was founded by Reeves and others. Hardy notes
in his memoirs that it soon began to do much harm to the
Corresponding Society.</p>

<p>Far aloof from this turmoil stands the solitary and inscrutable
figure of Pitt. At this time he was leading, almost with ostentation,
the life of a country gentleman, dividing his time between
Holwood and Walmer Castle. Very few of his letters of this
period survive. Writing from Walmer on 16th October to
Grenville, he makes merely a verbal alteration in an important
despatch on which the latter consulted him. Indeed he left the
conduct of foreign affairs to Grenville far more fully than he had
done to the Duke of Leeds. I have found no draft of a despatch
written wholly by Pitt at the time, or indeed at the crisis that
followed. There is, however, a significant phrase in his letter to
Grenville, that, if the French retained Savoy, this would bring
about a new order of things.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> For the most part Pitt at this
time gave himself up to rest and recreation at Walmer Castle.
The charm of the sea and of the Downs seems to have laid hold
on him; for General Smith, writing to Lord Auckland from
Walmer, says that Pitt is soon in love with the King's present
and gladly spends there all the time he can spare. Lord and
Lady Chatham were with him and encouraged his passion for
that retired spot. A little later he had a flying visit from one
who was to become a devoted friend, the brilliant and versatile
Earl of Mornington. Coming over from Ramsgate and lunching
at Walmer, he found that Pitt had so far taken up with country
sports as to follow the hounds in chase of "a basketted hare."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<p>Apart from the bad harvest and the spectre of want which
crept over the country, Pitt found little to alarm him at this
time. In preparation for the opening of Parliament, he distributed
to each of his friends six printed copies of his speech on
the abatement of the Spanish armament taxes, for the purpose of
circulation in the country.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Clearly he thought that the proposed
economies in the public services would salve the prevailing discontent.
At the close of October the French agent, No&euml;l, reported
to Lebrun that Pitt was not arming, and was still inclined
to hold aloof from French affairs.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> In fact, so late as 6th
November, Grenville wrote to Auckland that on all grounds
non-intervention in continental affairs is the best policy for
Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>But now a time drew near when anger was to expel calculation;
when the impulses of the populace flung aside the
counsels of statesmen, and the friends of universal peace helped
to loose the dogs of war. This new phase in the life of Europe
opened up when the dense columns of Dumouriez drove the
thin lines of Austria from a strong position at Jemappes
(6th November). Mons opened its gates on the following day;
and the other towns of Belgium speedily followed suit, the
French receiving a hearty welcome everywhere. The conquest
of the Belgic Provinces puffed up the French with boundless
pride mingled with contempt for the old Governments; and
these feelings awakened a formidable response in these islands.
The news of the conquest of the Pays Bas by the <span lang="fr">sansculottes</span>,
received with bewilderment and disgust in Piccadilly, aroused
wild hopes among the weavers of Spitalfields. "The activity
and insolence of the French emissaries and their allies in this
country have certainly increased much with Dumouriez's success,"
so wrote Grenville to Auckland on 26th November.</p>

<p>In these days we smile at the notion of foreign agents influencing
public opinion; but it seems certain that Chauvelin
and his staff made persistent efforts to fan the embers of discontent
into a flame.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Lord Sheffield declared that even the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>neighbourhood of Sheffield Park, near Lewes, was thoroughly
worked by French emissaries; but it is not unlikely that landlord
nervousness transfigured some wretched refugees, on their
way from the coast, into Jacobinical envoys. Certainly the town
which gave him his title was in a dangerous state. An officer
stationed there describes the joy of the men of Sheffield in celebrating
Dumouriez' victory. They roasted an ox whole, devoured
it, and then formed a procession, 10,000 strong, behind
the French tricolour and a picture which represented Dundas
stabbing Liberty and Burke treading down "the swinish multitude."
He states that they were enrolled in Corresponding
Societies, had bought firearms, and were seeking to corrupt the
soldiery.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Derby seems to have been equally fervid, if we may judge
by the address which on 20th November went from its branch
of the Society for Constitutional Information to the French
National Convention, couched in these terms. "It was reserved
for the Gallic Republic to break the accursed knot which has
leagued Kings for ages past against the rest of the world. Reason
and Philosophy are making great strides; and precedent and
hereditary notions go fast to decline. By teaching mankind that
they are all equal in rights, you have dedicated a glorious edifice
to Liberty, which must hereafter prove the dungeon of tyrants
and the asylum of the oppressed."<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Still more seditious was the action of the London Corresponding
Society. On 28th November Joel Barlow and John Frost,
deputed by that body, presented an address to the French Convention,
congratulating it on the triumphs of liberty, and assured
Frenchmen that innumerable societies and clubs were springing
up in England. "After the example given by France," they
said, "Revolutions will become easy. Reason is about to make
rapid progress; and it would not be extraordinary if in a much
less space of time than can be imagined, the French should send
addresses of congratulation to a National Convention of England."
They then informed the French deputies that 1,000 pairs
of shoes had come from the Society as a gift to the soldiers of
liberty, and the gift would be repeated weekly for the next six
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>weeks. They also presented an address which ended thus:
"Other nations will soon follow your steps in this career of
improvement, and, rising from their lethargy, will arm themselves
for the purpose of claiming the Rights of Man with that
all-powerful voice which man cannot resist." Next came a
deputation from the English and Irish residents in Paris, which
assured the French deputies that a majority of the British
people desired to copy their example, and that the old Governments
would soon survive merely as a memory. The three
addresses aroused immense enthusiasm, and a decree was passed
for their printing and circulation.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>These ecstatic praises of the Convention sounded oddly, as
that body had just been discussing a petition from several
Parisians who had lately been imprisoned without knowing why
or by whom. And the Belfast address of congratulation on the
progress of religious liberty was followed by the complaints of
two members of the Convention that they had been half drowned
at Chartres for a profession of atheism.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> But undoubtedly these
addresses by British Radicals caused exultation on both sides
of the Channel. Frenchmen believed that our people were
about to overthrow the Cabinet;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> while the visitors returned
home to trumpet forth the triumphs of Reason and the doom
of Tyranny.</p>

<p>Certainly the action of the French Convention seemed to assume
the speedy advent of a Jacobinical millennium. To the eye
of faith the headlong flight of the Austrians from Belgium opened
up boundless vistas of conquest, or rather, of fraternization with
liberated serfs. Consequently the month from 16th November
to 15th December witnessed the issue of four defiantly
propagandist decrees. That of 16th November enjoined on
French generals the pursuit of the Austrians on to any territory
where they might find refuge&mdash;obviously a threat to the German
and Dutch States near at hand. On the same day the French
deputies decreed freedom of navigation on the estuary of the
River Scheldt within the Dutch territory, which that people had
strictly controlled since the Treaty of M&uuml;nster (1648). In this
connection it is well to remember that the right of the Dutch to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>exclude foreigners from that estuary had been recognized by
France in five treaties signed with Great Britain since the Peace
of Utrecht. Further, by the Anglo-Dutch alliance of the year
1788, we had covenanted to uphold the rights of the Dutch in
this and other respects. Thus, the French Republic was taking
upon itself to rescind a well-established right of the Dutch
Republic.</p>

<p>There is, however, another side to this question. The law of
Nature, as distinct from the law of nations, forbade the barring
of a navigable river to the commerce of aliens; and in this particular
case the exclusive privileges retained by the Dutch had
almost strangled the trade of Antwerp. Visitors describe the
desolate aspect of the quays and streets in a city which was
clearly designed to be one of the great marts of the world. Of
this gospel of Nature, as set forth by Rousseau, the French were
the interpreters; but they would have done well to appeal to
Holland and Great Britain to abrogate this odious privilege,
adding also the assurance, formerly given by Dumouriez, that
Belgium would never become French.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the disinterested character of the crusade for
liberty was now belied by two additional decrees which created
the worst possible impression. On 19th November the French
Convention declared its resolve to "grant fraternity and assistance
to all people who wish to recover their liberty," and further
ordered its generals to give effect to this decree. Eight days later
it rescinded the former resolution, that France would make no
conquests, by ordering the incorporation of Savoy in the French
Republic. The priest Gr&eacute;goire was equal to the task of proving
that this involved no contradiction of the former principle, because
the Savoyards wished to join France and Nature herself
had proclaimed the desirability of union. By the same patriotic
logic France could rightfully absorb all parts of the Continent
where Jacobins abounded and natural frontiers were lacking.</p>

<p>These decrees brought about an entirely new situation. The
annexation of Savoy furnished a practical commentary on the
airy proposals announced on 16th and 19th November; but
these alone were sufficient to cause Pitt and Grenville the deepest
concern. On the 27th the latter wrote to Auckland at The
Hague in terms which show his conviction that France meant
to revolutionize the Dutch Republic, and also, if possible, Great
Britain. Respecting the decrees of the 16th and 19th he wrote:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
"The whole is a concerted plan to drive us to extremities, with
a view of producing an impression in the interior of the country."<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
That is, he believed the Convention to be set on forcing England
either to declare war, or to give way disgracefully; and in either
case the result would be an increase of seditious feeling in these
islands. This continued to be his view. For on 4th December,
after reading the seditious addresses of the English societies to
the Convention, he wrote again to Auckland that the French
evidently relied on the malcontents both in England and Holland
to paralyse the Governments; and, he added, "This is
above all others a reason for firmness in the present moment,
and for resisting, while the power of resistance is yet in our
hands. For the success of their unfounded claims would not
only give rise to new pretensions, but would give them additional
influence."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Pitt's views were the same, though he stated them
more firmly and not as an alarmist. On 9th December he
wrote to the Earl of Westmorland, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,
that the gross disregard of treaties shown of late by France,
her encouragement of the spirit of revolt in all lands, and her
public reception of addresses from English societies, "full of
treasonable sentiments," compelled the Government, though very
reluctantly, to add to the armed forces. He added these words:
"I am clear that the circumstances require vigour and decision
both at home and abroad. And the spirit of the country seems
within these last ten days to have taken so favourable a turn that
I think we may look with great confidence to the event."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Thus
Pitt and Grenville equally felt the need of firmness in resisting
the French decrees, partly because of their aggressive and illegal
nature, but also because surrender would inflate the spirits of
British malcontents.</p>

<p>Current events served to strengthen this opinion. France had
hitherto won all the points of the game by sheer audacity.
Everywhere she had attacked, and everywhere she had found unexpected
weakness. Custine's army had extorted a forced loan
from Frankfurt. Dumouriez was threatening Aix-la-Chapelle on
the east, and the Dutch on the north. The spirit which animated
the French Foreign Office appears in the letter which
Lebrun, its chief, wrote to Dumouriez on 22nd November: "To
the glory of having freed the Belgian Catholics, I hope you will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>join that of delivering their Batavian brothers from the yoke of
the Stadholder."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> There can be no doubt that the general laid
his plans for that purpose, though he also sent pacific overtures
to Auckland at The Hague.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>To crown the indignation of royalists, there came the tidings
that on 3rd December the French Convention decreed the trial
of Louis&nbsp;XVI for high treason against the nation. The news
aroused furious resentment; but it is noteworthy that Pitt and
Grenville rarely, if ever, referred to this event; and that, before
it was known, they had declared the impossibility of avoiding
a rupture with the French Government if it persisted in
adhering to the November decrees. On this question the final
court of appeal is the despatches and letters of our Ministers.
An examination of them discloses the reasons for their firmness.
On 13th November, when the evacuation of Brussels by the
Austrians was known, Ministers assured the Dutch Government
that they would oppose a French invasion of Holland.
They charged Auckland to declare that His Majesty had
"no hesitation as to the propriety of his assisting the Dutch Republic
as circumstances might require, against any attempt on
the part of any other Power to invade its dominions or to
disturb its Government." This declaration was to be published
in order to discourage the plots of the Dutch "Patriots," and to
warn the French Government and its general of the danger of
a hostile advance. Auckland replied on 16th November: "It is
impossible to convey to Your Lordships an adequate sense of the
impression made by this voluntary declaration of His Majesty's
sentiments and intentions respecting the Republic on the occasion
of the present crisis. The generosity of this measure, which
in a few hours was generally known, and which to-morrow will
be circulated on the Continent in the newspapers of the Republic,
is acknowledged by everyone." The Prince of Orange at once
wrote to thank the King for this proof of his friendship, and
added the suggestion that the anchoring of a British squadron
in the Downs would, more than anything else, tend to "hold in
check our enemies."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Pitt and Grenville did not comply with this last request; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>the British declaration itself came just two days too late to give
pause to the National Convention, before it published the
decree on the opening of the Scheldt. Possibly in the days of
telegraphs the warning would have been flashed from The Hague
to Paris in time. As it was, both Powers publicly committed
themselves on the same day to opposite courses of action from
which pride or conviction forbade them to recede. So narrow
sometimes is the space that at first divides the paths leading towards
peace and war.</p>

<p>The concern of Pitt and Grenville at the French conquest of
Belgium appears in their instructions to Stratton, our <span lang="fr">charg&eacute;
d'affaires</span> at Vienna, to confer with the Austrian Chancellor,
Cobenzl, on the threatening situation, setting forth the desire of
George&nbsp;III to contribute to the tranquillity of all the States of
Europe. In his reply of 22nd December Cobenzl declared that
Austria and Prussia must have indemnities for their expenses
in the war, the restoration of monarchy at Paris being another
essential to a settlement.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> These statements were most discouraging:
the former pointed to a speedy partition of Poland;
and the forcible restoration of the Bourbons was at this time
wholly repugnant to the feelings of Pitt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the prospect of war with France had become far
more threatening. The decree of 16th November on the
Scheldt, and that of 19th November on helping foreign malcontents,
were a direct defiance to all neighbouring States, and
especially to Great Britain and Holland. In the latter country
the Patriots were, as in 1787, actively helped from Paris, and
threatened the existence of the Orange <span lang="fr">r&eacute;gime</span>, of which we were
the guarantors. Moreover, the opening of the Scheldt was a
serious blow to Dutch commerce. Sir James Harris, writing
from The Hague in December 1784, when this very question
brought Joseph&nbsp;II to the brink of war with Holland, quoted the
declaration of the Grand Pensionary, that the Dutch ought to
spend their last florin "rather than submit to so destructive and
humiliating a measure as the opening of the Scheldt."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The
effusive thanks of the Dutch when the Court of Versailles opposed
the demand of Joseph&nbsp;II, shows that they looked on the
control of that estuary as vital to their interests. This question
was brought to an issue on 23rd November, when French
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>gunboats entered the Scheldt, and, despite the fire of the Dutch
guardship, made their way up the river in order to assist in
the reduction of the citadel of Antwerp. The senior captain of
the gunboats announced that he did this by order of Dumouriez.
On 8th December seven French ships sailed up to that city, the
first since the Treaty of M&uuml;nster.</p>

<p>The affair of the Scheldt was not the only cause of alarm.
The Dutch authorities managed to get a copy of a secret letter
(dated 20th November) from Dumouriez to Maulde, French
envoy at The Hague, in which he assured him that he would do
his best to keep him in that post (despite the ill will of the
Paris Government); for he had much need of him for certain
negotiations. He added these words: "I count on carrying
liberty to the Batavians (Dutch) as I have done to the Belgians;
also that the Revolution will take place in Holland so that
things will return to the state they were in 1788." The Dutch
Government gave a copy of this letter to Auckland, who forwarded
it to Grenville on 23rd November. It reached Whitehall
three days later. Curiously enough, Grenville did not hear
of the French decree for the opening of the Scheldt until 26th
November. But on that day he wrote to Auckland a despatch
which shows his conviction that France meant to force us into
war, and that the chief question for Great Britain and Holland
now was&mdash;when should hostilities begin? Clearly, then, Grenville,
and probably Pitt, regarded a rupture with France as unavoidable,
unless she revoked the aggressive decrees. Nevertheless they
decided to send a special envoy to Paris, and drew up rough drafts
undated and addressed to some person unnamed, bidding him
make careful inquiries into the state of affairs at that capital.</p>

<p>We cannot wonder that Pitt took a gloomy view of things;
for on 24th November a "moderate" member of the French
Convention proposed an addition to the decree of 19th November
(offering help to malcontents in other States), so as to limit
it to nations with which France was at war. This proposal&mdash;obviously
designed to soothe the apprehensions of Pitt&mdash;displeased
the "patriotic" majority, which disposed of it by carrying
the "previous question." After this the decree of 19th November
could no longer be treated as a meaningless effervescence of
Gallic enthusiasm; and, when taken with the disloyal addresses
presented by certain English clubs on 28th November, its reaffirmation
produced the worst possible impression.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<p>On the 29th, Nagel, the Dutch envoy in London, proffered a
formal appeal for help, in addition to requests which he had
made to Grenville a few days before. He further begged him
to order the assembling of a squadron at the Downs, or at
Gravesend, so as to assist the Dutch speedily, if need arose.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
Meanwhile our allies (as usually happens with small States in
presence of danger) sought to temporize; and herein, as also in
the caution of Pitt and Grenville, lay the reason why war did
not break out at once. No one can peruse the despatches of our
Ministers without seeing that they considered war inevitable,
unless the French retracted the obnoxious decrees. It is well to
notice that at this time the question of the trial of Louis&nbsp;XVI
had not come up for consideration. The dispute turned solely on
the frontier rights of the Dutch, which Pitt and his colleagues
believed to be violated by France, and which we were in honour
bound to vindicate.</p>

<p>On 1st December, then, came the first of those precautionary
measures which not seldom precipitate the conflict they are
designed to avert. The Cabinet issued a royal proclamation,
calling out part of the militia. Ministers took this step partly as
a retort to the seditious addresses of English Radical clubs to
the French Convention,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> partly in order to repress tumults.
There had been rioting in a few towns, and the reports from
Scotland were alarming. On 22nd November Dundas, writing
to Pitt from Melville Castle, N.B., stated that sedition had spread
rapidly of late in Scotland, and he estimated that five regiments
would be needed to hold down Dundee, Perth, and Montrose.
He added that the clergy of the Established Church and their
following were loyal, the others far otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Still worse was the news from Ireland. Early in 1792 the
Dublin Parliament repealed one or two of the most odious
statutes against Roman Catholics; but later in the year contumeliously
rejected their petition for the franchise. Consequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the mass of Irishmen was ready to join the Society of
United Irishmen, a formidable association founded in Ulster in
1791 by Wolfe Tone. This able young lawyer, fired with zeal
for the French Revolution, conceived the statesmanlike notion
of banding together both Presbyterians and Catholics in a
national movement against the exclusive and dominant English
caste. The conduct of the Dublin Parliament made his dream a
reality. At once the ultra-Protestant traders of the North clasped
hands with the Catholic gentry and peasants of the Centre and
South. This unheard-of union was destined to lead Pitt on to a
legislative experiment which will concern us later. Here we
may notice that the clubs of Irish malcontents proceeded to act
on a plan already mooted in the English societies, that of sending
delegates to form a National Convention in Dublin. The
aim was to constitute a body far more national than the corrupt
Protestant clique that sat in Parliament, and, after overawing
that body, to sunder the connection with England. The precedent
set by the Ulster Volunteers in their meeting at Dungannon
in 1782 warranted the hope of an even completer triumph
than was then secured. The correspondence that passed between
Pitt and the Lord-Lieutenant, Westmorland, reveals the concern
which they felt at the news. Pitt advised the early meeting
of the Dublin Parliament, the proposal of concessions sufficient
to allay discontent, and a determined resistance to all attempts
at intimidation. He also suggested the keeping a close watch on
the importation of arms, and levying a Militia if it were practicable.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
In reply Westmorland stated (1st December) that the manifesto
of a meeting of United Irishmen in Dublin was most threatening,
and that the "French mania" was spreading everywhere.
He added: "Belfast is, as always, noisy and republican; but
not above 200 or 300 Volunteers are there."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> It seems probable
that the embodying of the Militia in Great Britain was partly
with the view of enabling a few regular regiments to proceed to
Ireland.</p>

<p>While taking these precautionary measures, Pitt and Grenville
adopted a tone far from unfriendly to the French envoy. Earlier
in the autumn Grenville refused to see Chauvelin on the ground
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>that the French Government which sent him no longer existed.
But after some <span lang="fr">pourparlers</span> he consented to receive him on
29th November. With his usual <span lang="fr">hauteur</span> he prepared to teach
the ex-Marquis his place from the outset. He placed for him a
stiff small chair; but the envoy quickly repelled the slight and
vindicated the honour of the Republic by occupying the largest
arm-chair available. After this preliminary skirmish things went
more smoothly; but only the briefest summary of their conversation
can be given here. Chauvelin assured Grenville of the
desire of France to respect the neutrality of the Dutch, though
they had fired on two French vessels entering the Scheldt. The
opening of that river, he said, was a right decreed by Nature,
and confirmed to France by the conquest of Brabant&mdash;a point
which he pressed Grenville to concede. He then charged
England with unfriendly conduct in other respects. In reply
Grenville said that he welcomed this informal explanation, but
he declined to give any assurance on the Scheldt affair. If (said
he) France and England were not on good terms, it was not the
fault of the latter Power, which had consistently remained neutral
but declined to allow the rights of its Allies to be violated.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>Equally firm, though more affable, was the behaviour of Pitt
in an interview of 2nd December with a Frenchman who was
destined to become Foreign Minister under Napoleon. Maret,
the future Duc de Bassano, at this time made a very informal
<span lang="fr">d&eacute;but</span> on the stage of diplomacy. Despite many statements to
the contrary it is certain that he had no official position in
England. He came here merely in order to look after the affairs
of the Duke of Orleans, especially to bring back his daughter,
who had for some time resided in Suffolk with Mme. de Genlis
and "Pamela." Maret's own words to Miles are decisive on this
point: "I was not a secret agent; I had no authority to treat,
nor had I any mission; and in declaring this to Mr. Pitt and to
you I said nothing but the truth."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> With characteristic mendacity
Lebrun afterwards informed the Convention that Maret was a
secret agent and that Pitt had requested an interview with him.
The interview came about owing to the exertions of William
Smith, M.P., a well-intentioned Whig, who hoped much from an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>informal conversation between Pitt and one of the head clerks of
the French Foreign Office. Chauvelin viewed it with jealousy, it
being his aim to represent Maret as an emissary to the British
and Irish malcontents.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Pitt, when he granted the interview,
cannot have known of this, or of the design of Lebrun ultimately
to foist Maret into the place of Morgues at the French Embassy.
Accordingly he welcomed Maret cordially. No tactical skirmish
about chairs took place, and Maret afterwards declared that the
great Minister behaved affably throughout, brightening his converse
at times by a smile. As the personality of the two statesmen
and the gravity of the crisis invest this interview with
unique interest, Pitt's account of it, which is in the Pretyman
MSS., must be given almost in full.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>He [Maret] expressed his regret at the distant and suspicious terms
on which England and France appeared to stand, his readiness to give
me any <span lang="fr">&eacute;claircissement</span> he could, and his belief that the present French
Government would be very glad if means could be found by private
agents, with no official character, to set on foot a friendly explanation.</p>

<p>I told him that, if they were desirous of such an explanation, it
seemed to me much to be wished under the critical circumstances; as
we might by conversing freely learn whether it was possible to avoid
those extremities which we should very much regret but which seemed
from what we saw of the conduct and designs of France to be fast approaching;
and I then mentioned to him distinctly that the resolution
announced respecting the Scheldt was considered as proof of an intention
to proceed to a rupture with Holland; that a rupture with Holland
on this ground or any other injurious to their rights, must also lead to
an immediate rupture with this country; and that altho' we should
deeply regret the event and were really desirous of preserving, if possible,
the neutrality to which we had hitherto adhered, we were fully
determined, if the case arose, to give our utmost support to our ally.</p>

<p>His answer was that he hoped nothing of the sort would happen;
that he believed there was no design of proceeding to hostilities against
Holland; and that it was much the wish of the French Government to
be on good terms with this country; that they wished to <span lang="fr">m&eacute;nager
l'Angleterre</span>, and therefore to <span lang="fr">m&eacute;nager l'Hollande</span>; that these were the
sentiments of M. le Brun when he left Paris about 3 weeks ago; that he
believed them to be those of M. Dumouriez; and that, from the despatches
of M. Chauvelin, which he had seen while here, he believed
they continued to be those of the <span lang="fr">Conseil Ex&eacute;cutif</span>; that he thought a
confidential explanation on this subject very desirable; and would either
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>go to Paris or write to M. le Brun, to state what had passed in our
conversation, and that he was persuaded they would be disposed to
[send?] some other person here to enter privately into negotiations upon
it. He afterwards dropped an idea that some difficulty might perhaps
arise from the <span lang="fr">Conseil Ex&eacute;cutif</span> feeling itself pressed by the weight of
public opinion to propose to us to receive some person here in a formal
character. To this I observed that the circumstances would by no means
admit of any formal communication, and that they would certainly see
the necessity of avoiding the difficulties which must arise from such a
proposal, if they were sincere in wishing an explanation with a view to
remove obstacles.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the conversation, on his repeating his belief that
it would be the wish of the French Government to have such an explanation
and to remove, if possible, the grounds of misunderstanding, I
remarked to him that, if this was really desired, there was another point
which must be attended to&mdash;that he must have seen the impression
made here by the decree in France avowing a design of endeavouring
to extend their principles of government by raising disturbances in other
countries; that, while this was professed or attempted, and till we had
full security on this point, no explanation could answer its purpose, and
that such a conduct must be considered as an act of hostility to neutral
nations. He answered that he knew the impression which this circumstance
produced, and had seen the decree I mentioned with consternation;
that he believed it passed only in a moment of fermentation and
went beyond what was intended; that it could be meant only against
nations at war, and was considered as one way of carrying on war against
them; that he believed it was not conformable to the sentiments of the
<span lang="fr">Conseil Ex&eacute;cutif</span>, and that they might possibly find means to revise it.
To this I said that, whatever were the sentiments of the <span lang="fr">Conseil Ex&eacute;cutif</span>,
the decree, as it stood, might justly be considered by any neutral nation
as an act of hostility. He concluded by saying that he would immediately
send to M. le Brun an account of what had passed, which he
hoped might lead to happy consequences.</p>
</div>


<p>Maret prefaced his report of this interview by assuring
Lebrun that Pitt was decidedly in favour of peace, and in fact
dreaded war more than the Whig aristocrats; but, he added,
Lord Hawkesbury and the majority of Ministers were for war&mdash;a
somewhat doubtful statement. Maret's description of the
interview is graphic but far from complete. He reported Pitt's
gracious effort to minimize the difficulties of form arising from
the lapse of official relations between France and England. But
(he wrote) the Minister's brow darkened at the mention of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
names of No&euml;l and Chauvelin; and he finally suggested that
Maret should be the accredited French agent at London.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Pitt's account does not name these personal details, and it
lays more stress on the difficulties caused by the French decrees
opening the Scheldt and offering help to malcontents. We must
further remember that Maret's words of warning to his compatriots
on the latter subject were suppressed in the version
published at Paris, which therefore gave the impression that Pitt
was not deeply moved by recent events. This <span lang="la">suppressio veri</span>
partly accounts for the persistence of the French deputies in their
resolves, which prevented the friendly explanations undoubtedly
desired by Pitt and Maret.</p>

<p>Bad news also came in from The Hague, to the effect that the
French were demanding a passage through the Dutch fortress of
Maestricht. These tidings caused the worst impression. Grenville
wrote in reply to Auckland on 4th December. "The conduct of
the French in all their late proceedings appears to His Majesty's
servants to indicate a fixed and settled design of hostility against
this country and the [Dutch] Republic." Equally threatening
were "their almost undisguised attempts now making to excite
insurrection here and in Holland." Consequently His Majesty
had decided to arm in self defence, and he hoped that the Dutch
would firmly repel all attempts derogatory to their neutrality.
The King (he added), while taking these precautionary measures,
would not omit such steps as might lead to friendly explanations
with France through the private agents of that Government;
but no ambassador would be received.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Pitt and Grenville
set little store by the soothing explanations of Dumouriez and
his friend, Maulde, who had made overtures to Auckland which
met with a guarded but not unfavourable response. On their
renewal, Auckland received them coldly, remarking that the
whole situation was changed by the late violent decrees of the
French Convention. At that time, too, the friendly Maulde was
recalled and replaced by Tainville, "a professed Jacobin with
brutal manners and evident indiscretion,"<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Thus faded away the
last faint hopes in that quarter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>Equally sombre was the outlook at Paris. The pacific reports
sent by Maret and Maulde from London and The Hague were
before the French Ministers at their meeting on 5th December.
They had also the benefit of a lucid and suggestive <span lang="fr">M&eacute;moire</span>
sent by Talleyrand from London a week earlier, setting forth
the desirability of a friendly understanding between the two free
peoples, who, advancing hand in hand, might give liberty to
backward peoples (especially Spanish America), and draw
thence boundless benefits. It was the plan which Dumouriez and
he had drawn up in the spring of that year. Probably the
Executive Council took no notice of it; for certain papers found
in the iron chest at the Tuileries cast doubts on the purity
of Talleyrand's patriotism. Further, as Pache, Minister at
War, hated Dumouriez, personal bias told strongly against the
moderate proposals coming from London and The Hague.
Nevertheless the Executive Council now decided to defer for
the present the invasion of Holland, meanwhile chasing the
Austrians beyond the Rhine, and fortifying Antwerp. The last
step was declared not to infringe the principles of the Republic,
"which oppose the spirit of conquest."</p>

<p>Obviously there was nothing to prevent the same liberal
adaptation of these principles to Belgium as Gr&eacute;goire had proposed
for the welfare of the Savoyards. A few deputations of
the liberated people, asking for union with France, would enable
some equally skilful dialectician to discover that Belgium was
naturally a part of the Republic. For the present, however, the
Belgians sent a deputation to demand unconditional independence;
and it taxed the ingenuity even of <span class="ins" title="Barr&egrave;re">Bar&egrave;re</span>, then President
of the Convention, to waive aside that request, with airy phrases
as to the alliance of the two peoples emanating from the hands
of Nature herself (4th December).<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Pitt cannot have heard of the French Cabinet's decision of
5th December, but he must have read of the ambiguous treatment
of the Belgians at the bar of the Convention the day previously.
It had long been a maxim at Whitehall that the Pays
Bas must never go to France. To prevent such a disaster England
had poured forth blood and treasure for more than a century.
Pitt's resolve two years before, to maintain Austrian authority
in those provinces, had deeply offended Prussia. Now he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>and Grenville turned to the Court of Vienna, and on 7th December
made friendly overtures to Stadion, Austrian ambassador at
London.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Thus, the French menace ended the long period of
estrangement between Great Britain and Austria, though, as
will duly appear, mutual confidence took root very slowly.</p>

<p>On 9th December Lebrun sent off an important despatch to
Chauvelin. With respect to the decree of 19th November, it
stated that France would never demean herself by assisting
rioters, but would respond to the "general will" of a people that
desired to break its chains. Further, France could not reverse
her decision concerning the Scheldt. She would not revolutionize
Holland, but she expected Great Britain not to intervene in
support of a constitution which the Dutch considered "vicious
and destructive of their interests." Finally, the French Government
could not recognize the guarantees of the Dutch constitution
undertaken by England and Prussia in 1788.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> On the same
day Lebrun sent a message to Maret, who was still in London,
adverting in ironical terms to the military preparations in
England, at which the French would feel no alarm, and insinuating
that the doctrines of liberty were making rapid progress
there. As to negotiations, the only bases on which they could
proceed were the recognition of the Republic, and the refusal of
the French Cabinet to treat except by a fully accredited envoy.</p>

<p>On receipt of this letter on the 14th, Maret at once showed
it to Miles, who urged him to request an immediate interview
with the Prime Minister. This was accorded, and at 8 p.m. of
that day, Maret met Pitt again. I have found no account of
this interview. All we know is that it was short and depressing.
Maret had to impart the unwelcome news that all the
communications to the French Government must pass through
the hands of Chauvelin&mdash;a personal triumph for that envoy.
Pitt on his side declined to give any answer on the subject of
Maret's communication, or on that of receiving Chauvelin.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> We
can imagine that under that stiff and cold exterior the Prime
Minister concealed deep agitation; for the determination of the
French rigidly to adhere to their decrees, to force Chauvelin
upon the British Government, and to require the recognition of
the French Republic, meant war.</p>

<p class="title spaced">THE RUPTURE WITH FRANCE</p>

<p class="quote" lang="fr" style="font-style: normal">La guerre aux rois &eacute;tait la cons&eacute;quence naturelle du proc&egrave;s fait au roi de
France; la propagande conqu&eacute;rante devait &ecirc;tre li&eacute;e au r&eacute;gicide.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sorel.</span></p>


<p>The opening of Parliament on 13th December 1792 took
place amidst circumstances that were depressing to friends
of peace. Affairs were gyrating in a vicious circle. Diplomacy,
as we have seen, had come to a deadlock; but more threatening
even than the dispute between Pitt and Lebrun were the rising
passions of the two peoples. The republican ferment at Paris
had worked all the more strongly since 20th November, the date
of the discovery of the iron chest containing proofs of the anti-national
intrigues of the King and Queen. Hence the decree
(3rd December) for the trial of Louis&nbsp;XVI at the bar of the
Convention with its inevitable sequel, the heating of royalist
passion in all neighbouring lands. It is one of the many mishaps
of the revolutionary movement that its enthusiasm finally
aroused an opposite enthusiasm, its fury begot fury, and thus
set in a series of cyclones which scarcely spent their force even
at Waterloo.</p>

<p>An essentially philosophic movement at the outset, the
French Revolution was now guided by demagogues and adventurers,
whose only hope of keeping erect lay in constant and
convulsive efforts forwards. Worst symptom of all, its armies
already bade fair to play the part of the Praetorians of the later
Roman Empire. Nothing is more singular at this time than the
fear of the troops. Amidst the distress prevalent at Paris, much
apprehension was felt at the return of the armies of Custine and
Dumouriez. In part, of course, this uneasiness arose from a
suspicion that these men, especially the latter, might take up the
<span lang="fr">r&ocirc;le</span> of Monk and save Louis. But a member of the French
Convention assured Miles that the disbanding of those tumultuary
forces would bring on a social crisis.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>War, [he wrote on 9th December] is to a certain extent inevitable,
not so much for the purpose of opening the Scheldt, for that is rather a
pretext in order to animate the people and preserve their enthusiasm,
but to get rid of 300,000 armed vagabonds, who can never be allowed
to return without evident risk to the Convention and Executive Council....
It is her opinion [Madame Roland's] and mine that we cannot
make peace with the Emperor without danger to the Republic, and
that it would be hazardous to recall an army, flushed with victory and
impatient to gather fresh laurels, into the heart of a country whose
commerce and manufactures have lost their activity, and which would
leave the disbanded multitude without resources or employment.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>
</div>


<p>These words are noteworthy; for they show that prudential
or party motives led some at least of the Girondins, formerly
friends of England, to desire an extension of the war.</p>

<p>In England, too, the war spirit was rising. The traditional
loyalty of the land had been strengthened by the tactful behaviour
of George&nbsp;III since Pitt's accession to power. These
feelings warmed to a steady glow at the time of the King's
illness in 1788&ndash;9; and now the trial of Louis&nbsp;XVI, albeit on
grounds which Britons could not understand, seemed an act of
contemptible cruelty. To bring Louis from Versailles to Paris,
to load him with indignities at the Tuileries, to stop his despairing
bolt for freedom, to compass his downfall, to attack him in
his palace and massacre his defenders, to depose him, and now
to try him for his life for the crime of helping on his would-be
deliverers, appeared to a nation of sportsmen a series of odious
outrages on the laws of fair play. The action of certain Radical
Clubs in sending addresses of congratulation to the National
Convention also aroused deep disgust; and (as Bland Burges
wrote to Auckland on 18th December) Loyal Associations
sprang up on all sides.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> A typical address was sent by the
Dover Association to Pitt, as Lord Warden, on 19th December,
asking for permission to take arms in defence of King
and Constitution against invaders from without or levellers
within.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The example was widely followed; and thus, as usually
happens in this land, the puny preparations of Government were
helped on by the eager exertions of the people.</p>

<p>The revulsion in public opinion early in December was so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>marked as to impress even Chauvelin. He warned Lebrun that
within a month the English had so changed as scarcely to be
recognizable; but he added: "Pitt seems to have killed public
opinion in England." A conversation which Sheridan had with
him on 7th December ought to have disproved this fable. The
Whig orator sternly reprobated the French decree of 19th
November, offering aid to malcontents, and stated that the Opposition
desired peace with France, but not if she attacked
Holland. Nine-tenths of the people would resent any attempt
to interfere with England or her Allies.</p>

<p>This patriotic utterance of Sheridan expressed the feelings
of a large part of the Whig Opposition. Parliament on 13th
December showed marked approval of the King's Speech, which,
while affirming his peaceful intentions, asserted his resolve to
strengthen the forces. Lansdowne and Stanhope struck a few
jarring notes; but in the Commons the Opposition was almost
paralysed by a split between the New and Old Whigs. At a
meeting of the party, held on 11th December at Burlington
House, the majority decided to support the Government. Indeed
Parliament would probably have presented a united front
but for the action of Lansdowne, Stanhope, and Fox. Much
depended on the conduct of the great orator at this crisis.
A warning uttered by him to French Republicans might have
had the most salutary effect. Unfortunately his conduct was
such as to impair the unity of English sentiment and thereby to
encourage the delusions of the men in power at Paris. In the
meeting on 11th December he asserted that there was no fear
of a revolt (in which he was doubtless correct) and that the
calling out of the Militia was a mere trick, which he would
strenuously oppose. He admitted that we must support the
Dutch if they were attacked, and disapproved of the French
decree respecting the Scheldt, but strongly deprecated war on
that account. On the 12th he threw caution to the winds, and
stated with an oath that there was no address that Pitt could
frame on which he would not propose an amendment and divide
the House.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> This is party spirit run mad; but it was in that
spirit that Fox went to the House on the 13th.</p>

<p>There he made one of his finest flights of oratory. None of
his speeches excels it in beauty of diction and matchless energy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>of thought. Most forcible was the passage in which he derided
the ministerial maxim that the canon of English laws and
liberties was complete; that we might thenceforth stand still,
and call upon a wondering world to admire it as a model of
human perfection. Even more biting were his taunts at Ministers
for seeking to stamp out the discontent which their injustice and
violence had created.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>You have gone upon the principles of slavery in all your proceedings;
you neglect in your conduct the foundation of all legitimate government,
the rights of the people; and, setting up this bugbear, you spread
a panic for the very purpose of sanctifying this infringement, while
again the very infringement engenders the evil which you dread. One
extreme naturally leads to another. Those who dread republicanism fly
for shelter to the Crown. Those who desire Reform and are calumniated
are driven by despair to republicanism. And this is the evil that I
dread. These are the extremes into which these violent agitations hurry
the people, to the decrease of that middle order of men who shudder as
much at republicanism on the one hand as they do at despotism on the
other.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>
</div>


<p>He then taunted Ministers with abandoning Poland and not
opposing the coalition of Austria and Prussia, and asserted
that the Cabinet refused to negotiate with France because she
was a Republic, and her Ministers had not been anointed with
the holy oil of Rheims. The weakest part of the speech was
that which dealt with the existing crisis. For of what use was
it to point out where Ministers had gone astray months and
years before, if he did not now mark out for them a practicable
course? In truth, though the prince of debaters, Fox lacked
self-restraint, balance of judgement, and practical sagacity. The
sole important issue was the encouraging of the peace party at
Paris, with a view to the revocation of the aggressive decrees of
the Convention. In private, Fox had admitted that they were
wholly indefensible; and yet, in order to snatch an oratorical
triumph, he fired off a diatribe which could not but stiffen the
necks of the French Jacobins. At such a crisis the true statesman
merges the partisan in the patriot and says not a word to
weaken his own Government and hearten its opponents. To
this height of self-denial Fox rarely rose; and the judgement
alike of his fellows and of posterity has pronounced this speech
a masterpiece of partisan invective and of political fatuity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>For how was it possible to recognize the French Republic
until it had withdrawn its threats to existing Governments?
Pitt had reason to believe that a firm protest against the
aggressive decrees of November was the only means of averting
an overturn of international law. He took the proper means
of protesting against them, and his protest was disregarded. In
such a case, to recognize a revolutionary Government which had
just proclaimed its sympathy with malcontents and its resolve
to dictate terms to our Dutch allies, would have been a sign of
weakness. There was but one chance of peace, namely, that
Parliament should give so overwhelming a support to Pitt and
Grenville as to convince the tyros at Paris that they had to do,
not with a clique, but a nation. This unanimity the efforts of
Fox impaired. Some of his friends voted with him from a sense
of personal regard; but the greater number passed over to the
Government or did not vote. Consequently the Foxites mustered
50 votes against 290.</p>

<p>Equally inopportune was his motion of 15th December, for
sending a Minister to Paris to treat with that Government. His
knowledge of all that went on at the French Embassy in Portman
Square was so exact (witness his repetition publicly on the
13th of the very words of one of Lebrun's despatches to Chauvelin),<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
that he must have known of the informal communications
between Pitt and Maret, and of the arrival on the 14th of
despatches from Paris, which negatived the requests of the Prime
Minister. Doubtless it was this last circumstance which curtailed
and weakened Fox's second speech. Grey, Erskine, and Whitbread
vigorously supported the motion; but there was a general
feeling that the despatch of an ambassador to Paris would be a
weak acquiescence in the French claims. The motion was therefore
negatived. Pitt was not present at these first debates, not
having yet been re-elected by the University of Cambridge after
his recent acceptance of the Lord Wardenship of the Cinque
Ports. The defence of the Government therefore devolved chiefly
upon Dundas, Windham, and Burke&mdash;a significant conjunction
of names. On 16th December Burke for the first time took his
seat on the Treasury Bench.</p>

<p>A national party might now have been formed but for the
inaction of the Duke of Portland. During the meetings at his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>mansion, Burlington House, he evinced strong disapproval of
the views of Fox; and, as official leader of the Whigs, he had it
in his power to bring nearly the whole of the party over to the
Government side. From this course, which would have placed
country above party, the Duke shrank; and his followers were
left to sort themselves at will. There was a general expectation
that Portland would publicly declare against Fox; but friendship
or timidity held him tongue-tied. Malmesbury sought to waken
him from his "trance," but in vain.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> He lay under "the wand
of the magician" (Pitt's phrase for the witchery that Fox exerted),
even when so staunch a Whig as Sir Gilbert Elliot saw that the
wizard's enchantments were working infinite mischief.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>Owing to the wrong-headedness of Fox and the timidity of
Portland, Pitt's triumph in the Commons was not decisive enough
to tear the veil away from the eyes of the French Jacobins.
Nothing short of unanimity at Westminster could have worked
that miracle. Surely not even that novice in diplomacy, Lebrun,
would have threatened to appeal from the British Government
to the British nation, had he not believed the Government to be
without support.</p>

<p>This delusion appears in the memorable decree of 15th December.
The French Convention thereby asserts its resolve to
revolutionize all countries where its armies are or shall come.
It will recognize no institutions alien to the principles of Liberty,
Equality, and Fraternity. All feudal dues, customs, and privileges
are to be annulled, and the liberated people will meet in primary
assemblies to organize an Administration. Arrangements will
be made for defraying the expenses of the liberating army, and
for maintaining it while it remains.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Finally France declares
that she will treat as an enemy the people which refuses to
accept Liberty and Equality, and tolerates its prince and
privileged castes. The decree is at once followed by a proclamation
drawn up for the benefit of the subject peoples whom it
may concern. Finally, the Convention decides that the course
of rivers must everywhere be free, and directs its generals to
enforce that principle with respect to the Scheldt.</p>

<p>In view of this stern reiteration of the right to overturn all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>Governments that conflict with revolutionary principles, it is
impossible to consider the decree of 19th November, offering
assistance to malcontent peoples, as a meaningless display of
emotion. Subsequent events threw a sinister light on it. The
annexation of Savoy on 27th November was not a convincing
proof of altruism; and the refusal of the Executive Council, on
8th and 9th December, to reconsider its decision on the Scheldt,
marked a firm resolve to carry out French policy in the Pays
Bas, even if it led to war with England. Now there came, as a
damning corollary, the decree of 15th December, which flung
defiance at all Governments of the old type. Like Mohammed,
Lebrun stood forth with the "Contrat Social" in one hand, the
sword in the other, and bade the world take its choice.</p>

<p>For England there could be no doubt. Pitt and Grenville had
decided that the only chance of peace lay in offering a firm
front to every act of aggression. In this they had general support.
Fox might choose to distort facts by declaring that
Ministers were about to plunge the country into war on a matter
of form<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> (the refusal to treat officially with the French Republic);
but everyone knew that the first aggressive action was that of
France, directed against the Anglo-Dutch alliance. The firmness
of Ministers gained them support in unexpected quarters.
On 20th December, when they asked for a vote for 25,000 seamen,
including 5,000 marines, Sheridan heartily declared that
he would have supported a vote for 40,000 seamen if that number
had been deemed necessary. He also made a suggestion
that the British Parliament or people should appeal to the
generous instincts of Frenchmen to spare the life of Louis&nbsp;XVI.
The proposal came somewhat oddly in a debate for increasing
our forces against France; and it brought up Burke in one of
his most acrid moods. Such an appeal, he said, was futile, for
Louis was in the custody of assassins who were both accusers
and judges: his death was inevitable. Sheridan and Fox heartily
reprobated this recklessly vindictive language.</p>

<p>Pitt then pointed out that on 17th August George&nbsp;III had
expressed an earnest desire for the safety of Louis and the Royal
Family of France in terms which were then read out. The same
was the desire of every Briton; and the sentiments now expressed
in that House would be heard and noted at Paris. If any more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>formal measure were to be adopted, he suggested the entering
a protest in the Journals of the House; but any public representation,
he said, must be couched in terms of indignation
which must tend to defeat its own object. With this method of
procedure Fox and Sheridan expressed their entire concurrence.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
It is therefore a malicious falsehood to say that Pitt opposed
their suggestion.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Burke certainly did so, and in the worst possible
taste; but Pitt carried it out so far as was deemed desirable.
If Sheridan and Fox wished for a public appeal, it was for them
to set it on foot.</p>

<p>I must here notice the vague and misleading statements in
Godoy's Memoirs (written a generation later) that Spain made
strenuous efforts to save the life of Louis&nbsp;XVI and opened "an
unlimited credit" at Paris with the view of bribing members of
the Convention to secure his acquittal. Further, that he, Godoy,
secretly approached Pitt in order to secure his financial aid,
which that statesman obstinately refused.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The story does not
hang well together; for if Spain had already opened an unlimited
credit at Paris, why did she want pecuniary help from Pitt?
Further, the opening of unlimited credit, presumably with a
Parisian bank, did not consort well with the secret methods
which were essential to the success of the plan.</p>

<p>In order to probe this matter to the bottom, I have examined
the British Foreign Office archives relating to Spain for the
months of December and January. They are detailed and apparently
complete. F. J. Jackson, our <span lang="fr">charg&eacute; d'affaires</span> at
Madrid, wrote to Lord Grenville every three or four days, as the
relations of the two States had been far from cordial owing to
friction caused by the cession of Nootka Sound, Captain Vancouver
having been employed to settle the boundaries and fix
a neutral zone between the two Empires. Grenville also wrote
three times to Jackson to express his apprehension that the
timidity and poverty of Spain would cause her to yield to the
French Republic in the matter of some demonstrations on the
frontier. But there is no word implying that Spain requested
help from England, either pecuniary or diplomatic, in order to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>save Louis. Early in January Charles&nbsp;IV made such an appeal
to the French Convention, but it was treated with contemptuous
indifference. At that time the Courts of London and Madrid
were beginning to draw closer together in order to withstand
the demands of France; but nothing passed between them
officially respecting the saving of Louis. Now, where the life of
a King was at stake, any communication must have been official,
and if it were made through the Spanish ambassador in London,
Grenville would certainly have referred to it in his despatches
to Madrid.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> We may therefore dismiss Godoy's story as a cruel
and baseless slander, due to the spiteful desire of a discredited
politician to drag down a great name nearer to his own level.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that Malouet, who was then in close
touch with Grenville on San Domingo affairs, does not mention
in his Memoirs any attempt to involve the Cabinet in a scheme
for bribing the Convention&mdash;an action which the French exiles
in England and Holland were perfectly able to carry out themselves
had they been so minded. The only document bearing
on this question is a Memorial drawn up on 7th December by
Malouet, Lally-Tollendal, and Gillier, stating their horror at the
King's trial, and their belief that his life might be spared if
George&nbsp;III and the British Government issued a Declaration
stating their lively interest in Louis&nbsp;XVI and his family, their
resolve for ever to refuse an asylum to all regicides, and to cut
off all supplies of food from France if the crime were committed.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
The Memorial was probably presented to Lord Grenville; but
its inutility, or danger, in the proud and exacting mood then
prevalent at Paris, is obvious. The confidential reports sent by
"M. S." from Paris to Lord Grenville do not refer to any such
overture to the Cabinet.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, there is the curious fact that the ex-abb&eacute; No&euml;l, one of
Chauvelin's "advisers," came to Miles late on 18th December,
and affected much concern at the prospect of the execution
of Louis. He then suggested that Pitt should confer with a
M. Talon, residing in Sloane Street, who had immense resources
and stood well with all parties in France, in order to devise some
means for saving the life of that monarch. When Miles asked
No&euml;l how Pitt was to assist in this laudable project, no answer
was forthcoming. We must commend No&euml;l's prudence; for he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>had already stated that Talon was under impeachment in
France. How a man accused of treason could help his King,
save by secretly using some of his immense resources to bribe
the deputies, is no more apparent to us than it was to Miles. In
fact he detected a snare in this effort to associate Pitt with a
wealthy French exile in what must evidently be merely an
affair of bribery. He therefore declined to bring the matter
before Pitt, whereupon No&euml;l betrayed signs of satisfaction at
finding that the Minister really was neutral on French internal
affairs.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> This little episode should open the eyes of detractors
of Pitt to the extraordinary difficulty of his position. Of one
thing we may be certain. The readiest way of assuring the
doom of the hapless monarch was to take up some one of the
silly or guileful schemes then mooted for pressing the British
Government to take sides in the trial. Pitt's rigorous neutrality
was the best means of helping the advocates of Louis in their
uphill fight with the hostile Convention.</p>

<p>Reverting to events at Westminster, we note that Ministers,
on 21st December, introduced into the Upper House an Aliens
Bill for subjecting to supervision the many thousands of foreigners
who had flocked to these shores. The debates on this
measure showed some approach to unanimity, though Lansdowne
and Lauderdale in the Lords, and Fox in the Commons
opposed it as a breach of the hospitable traditions of this land.
On the 28th Burke spoke in its support with his usual passion,
flinging down a Birmingham dagger as a sign of the French
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>fraternity now introduced into these happy islands.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> After a
few alterations in committee, the Bill passed on the last day of
the year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on 18th December, Lebrun had sent to the Convention
a report on the negotiations, which was not adapted to
soften the passions of the time, being merely a piece of parliamentary
declamation; but, as declamation rather than reason
held sway at Paris, some of its phrases must be quoted. After
citing with approval passages from the recent speech of Fox,
Lebrun referred to the eager interest taken by the British nation
in the triumphs of the French arms. "But," he continued, "these
glorious events have a quite contrary effect upon the English
Minister. In a moment, the dread and jealousy of our victories,
the entreaties of cowardly rebels [the French <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span>], the vile
intrigues of hostile Courts, and the secret suspicions that the
numerous addresses from all parts of England excited, determined
him to more decisive military preparations and to an
immediate assembling of Parliament." Lebrun then accused
Pitt of seeking to stir up public opinion against France, and
of exciting, "by the most corrupt means, distrusts, doubts, and
disorders." A still more extraordinary charge followed, namely,
that Pitt and Grenville, while refusing to acknowledge the
French diplomatic agents, had "requested to see them confidentially,
to hold communications with them, and to grant
them secret conferences."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Lebrun then referred in contemptuous
terms to the British naval preparations, and stated that he
had firmly maintained the decree respecting the Scheldt. He
then affirmed the reasonableness of the decree of 19th November;
and scouted the notion that France harboured designs
against Holland. In answer to this last he had said in effect:
"That it was much to be wished that the British Ministry had
never meddled more with the internal government of that
Republic than we ourselves wish to meddle." Finally, if these
disputes led to a rupture, "the war will be only the war of the
British Minister against us; and we will not fail to make a
solemn appeal to the English nation."&nbsp;... "In short, we will
leave it to the English nation to judge between us, and the issue
of this contest may lead to consequences which he [Pitt] did
not expect."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>In the sordid annals of party strife this report of Lebrun
holds a high place. In order to furbish up the dulled prestige of
the Gironde he sought to excite national animosity, and to
revive the former hatred of the name of Pitt. What could be
more criminal than to sneer at the smallness of England's naval
preparations? What more false than to charge Pitt and Grenville
with secretly begging for interviews with agents whom outwardly
they scorned? It is by acts like these that nations are
set by the ears; and generally they are at one another's throats
before the lie can be exposed. Lebrun's report was received
with loud applause. No one questioned the accuracy of its details;
and these blind followers of a blind guide unanimously
voted that it should be printed and widely circulated. On 20th
December Lebrun sent a copy of it to Chauvelin, along with
instructions which lost none of their emphasis in the note drawn
up at Portman Square. He forwarded another copy of the report
to No&euml;l, with this significant explanation: "This document will
keep you in touch with the ideas of this country and will show
you that I scarcely have this affair in my hands any longer."<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>This admission is illuminating. The trial of Louis&nbsp;XVI had,
as the men of the Mountain foresaw, placed the Girondin
Ministry and its followers in a most embarrassing position.
Many of them inclined to mercy or to compromises which found
little favour with the populace. Accordingly, the procedure at
the trial, as also the final verdict, turned largely on the desperate
efforts of the Jacobins to discredit their rivals, who sought by
all means to keep their foothold in the revolutionary torrent.
One of the most obvious devices was to represent the Executive
Council as the champion of ultra-democratic ideas as against
envious and reactionary England. If this notion gained currency,
Lebrun and his colleagues might hope still to ride on the crest
of the wave.</p>

<p>Historical students will remember another occasion when a
tottering Ministry sought to keep pace with public opinion at
Paris. The Duc de Gramont on 12th July 1870 instructed the
French ambassador, Benedetti, to insist on obtaining from King
William of Prussia an immediate answer to a demand that was
certain to arouse angry feelings; and he sent to Benedetti the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>explanation that public opinion was <em>outflanking</em> the Ministry,
and that "the effervescence of spirits is such that we do not
know whether we shall succeed in mastering it." Thus, twice
within eighty years France was hurried towards the brink of the
precipice because her Foreign Minister could not control an
effervescence of spirits which he himself had helped to excite.</p>

<p>Lebrun's missives of 20th December bore fruit seven days
later in Chauvelin's despatch to Grenville. As this document
has often been printed, only a brief summary need be given
here. The French envoy insisted that the conduct of France towards
England had throughout been correct and conciliatory; but
the Executive Council had long observed with concern the unfriendliness
of the British Ministers, and now pressed its envoy
to demand definitely whether they held the position of a neutral
or an enemy. The only possible cause of enmity could be a
misinterpretation of the decree of 19th November, which obviously
applied merely to peoples that demanded the fraternal
aid of Frenchmen. As France wished to respect the independence
of England and her allies, she would not attack the Dutch.
The opening of the Scheldt, however, was a question decided
irrevocably by reason and justice, besides being a matter of small
moment; and the British Ministers could not venture to make
it a cause of war. If they did, they would not be supported by
the British people. Chauvelin then demanded an official reply,
and expressed the hope that the British Cabinet would not engage
in a war for which it alone would be responsible and to
which the people would not accord its support.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>What Pitt and Grenville thought of Chauvelin's last effort on
behalf of peace will best appear in Grenville's despatch of 28th
December to Auckland at The Hague:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>The tone and language of Chauvelin's note of the 27th appear calculated
to accelerate a rupture, and the same conclusion seems to follow
from the circumstance of M. Maret's having informed Mr. Pitt that it
was not intended by the <span lang="fr">Conseil Ex&eacute;cutif</span> to charge any private agent
with any commission of the nature which he had himself suggested in
his first conference. I have some reason to believe that it is now intended
to bring forward immediately in Holland the same question of
receiving formal and official communication from the <span lang="fr">Conseil Ex&eacute;cutif</span>.
I trust that the answer will be conformable to opinions entertained here;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>and, with the view of avoiding as far as possible, any difference, however
slight, in the expression of our sentiments, I shall lose no time in sending
to Your Excellency the copy of the answer to M. Chauvelin when it is
settled.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude this dispatch without again urging Your Excellency
to press in the strongest manner possible upon the Dutch Ministers
the necessity of immediately bringing forward their whole force. It is
evident that the present intentions of France are those of aggression.
Whichever of the Allies is first attacked, there can be no doubt under the
present circumstances, but that they must make common cause in order
to render the calamity of war short, if it is unavoidable. And if the state
of the preparations of the Republic is found inadequate to the emergency,
the attack will certainly be first made there where least resistance
is expected. Every circumstance therefore, of interest and dignity require
[<span lang="la">sic</span>] that no exertion of which the Republic can be made capable, should
be spared at such a moment as the present.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>
</div>


<p>Evidently Grenville looked on Chauvelin's note as an ultimatum;
and it is noteworthy that Pitt on 28th December refused
to see Chauvelin. Our Dutch Allies, however, were by no
means ready. The separate Admiralties of the Dutch Provinces
had not enough men to equip, still less to man, their ships; and
almost their only defence lay in a British squadron which set
sail for Flushing on or about 29th December.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>For the present, then, Pitt and Grenville contented themselves
with sending a stiff rejoinder to Chauvelin's note. Grenville
reminded him that he had no official character in this country
since the fall of the French monarchy, and that the sinister
meaning of the decree of 19th November, as shown in the public
reception given at Paris to the promoters of sedition in this
country, was in no wise cleared away by his recent declaration,
which still claimed the right to encourage disloyalty. With
regard to the Scheldt question, Grenville declared again that it
was of the highest importance both in point of fact and of principle;
of fact, because the action of France pre-supposed her
sovereignty of the Low Countries; of principle, because, if passed
over, it would give her the right to abrogate treaties at her will.
The desire of England to preserve strict neutrality in French
affairs was universally acknowledged, and he (Chauvelin) had
not urged a single circumstance in disproof of it. But, England
(continued Grenville) "will never see with indifference that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>France shall make herself, either directly or indirectly, sovereign
of the Low Countries, or general arbitress of the rights and
liberties of Europe. If France is really desirous of maintaining
friendship and peace with England, she must show herself disposed
to renounce her views of aggression and aggrandisement,
and to confine herself within her own territory, without insulting
other Governments, without disturbing their tranquillity, without
violating their rights."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>This stern rebuke to the flippant claim of the French Ministers
to settle the affairs of neighbouring States in accord with
their own principles has often been ascribed to Pitt himself.
This is doubtful. I can find no proof that he intervened directly
in the affairs of the Foreign Office after the accession of Grenville,
as he had done in the days of the Duke of Leeds. Perhaps
the austere personality of Grenville forbade any intervention;
or it may be that the two cousins were in so complete an agreement
on principles that Pitt left all details to the Foreign Minister.
Certain it is that he himself remained almost passive at this
time; and all the acts were the acts of Grenville. It was well
known that the two men were in close touch. "I consider his
lordship the same as Mr. Pitt," wrote Miles to Aust.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>More important is the question&mdash;What were the aims of the
British Government for the settlement of Europe? Fortunately,
we are able to answer this without a shadow of doubt. For on
29th December Grenville sent off a despatch to Whitworth at
St. Petersburg referring to an effusive offer of alliance from
Catharine&nbsp;II. Through Vorontzoff, her envoy at London, she
expressed her admiration of the generous conduct of George&nbsp;III,
and her earnest desire to help him in restoring order to Europe
by means of a concert of the Powers, which might be formed at
London. At the same time she found means to instruct her
partisans in the British Parliament to relax their efforts against
the Ministry.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Pitt and Grenville were not dazzled by these proposals.
The latter generously declared to Auckland that he did
not believe the Opposition to be influenced by unpatriotic motives;
and he doubted the sincerity of Catharine's offer.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Nevertheless,
in view of the imminence of a French attack on Holland, Grenville
decided to encourage the Czarina to form a league of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>Powers; but the instructions which he sent on 29th December
to Whitworth set forth aims very different from hers. He suggested
that the Powers not yet at war should invite the French
people to accept the following terms:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>The withdrawing of their arms within the limits of the French territory:
the abandoning their conquests; the rescinding any acts injurious to
the sovereignty or rights of any other nations; and the giving, in some
public and unequivocal manner, a pledge of their intention no longer to
foment troubles and to excite disturbances against their own Governments.
In return for these stipulations the different Powers of Europe
who should be parties to this measure might engage to abandon all
measures or views of hostility against France or interference in their
internal affairs, and to maintain a correspondence or intercourse of
amity with the existing powers in that country with whom such a treaty
may be concluded. [If, however, France refuses to give these pledges,
then the Powers will take] active measures to obtain the ends in view,
and it may be considered whether, in such a case, they might not
reasonably look to some indemnity for the expenses and hazards to
which they would necessarily be exposed.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>
</div>


<p>From this remarkable pronouncement it appears that Pitt
and Grenville harboured no hostility to the French Republic
as such, provided that it acted on the principles which it professed
up to the end of October 1792. The ensuing acts of
aggression and propagandism they unflinchingly opposed, but
in the hope that the combined remonstrances of all the Powers
would induce the French leaders to withdraw their untenable
claims. Above all, the British Cabinet did not refuse
eventually to recognize the new state of things at Paris, a point
of view very far removed from the flaming royalism of
Catharine&nbsp;II and Burke. Whether a concert of the Powers could
have been formed on these moderate terms is very doubtful.
What is certain is that Pitt and Grenville saw in it the chief
hope of peace, and that they did not desire to force royalty on
reluctant France. For them the war, if it came, was not a war
of opinion&mdash;Monarchy <span lang="la">versus</span> Republic. It was a struggle to
preserve the Balance of Power, which in all ages our statesmen
had seen to be incompatible with the sovereignty of France in
the Low Countries. That danger averted, they were content to
let France settle her own affairs, if she behaved with the like
tolerance towards her neighbours.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p>Unhappily, these pacific and enlightened views were not accompanied
by conciliatory manners. It was the bane of Pitt,
and still more of Grenville, that their innate reserve often cooled
their friends and heated their opponents.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> In the case of so vain
and touchy a man as Chauvelin a little affability would have
gone a long way; and this was especially desirable, as he had
enough support at Paris to thwart the attempt to replace him
by some envoy less disliked at St. James's. Nevertheless, they
persisted in their resolve not to recognize him officially; and
the Executive Council made it a point of honour to force him
on the British Court. Personal questions therefore told against
a peaceful settlement. Even at the end of the year 1792 it was
not wholly impossible, provided that the questions in dispute
were treated with open-mindedness and a desire to understand the
point of view of the opponent.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it was for the French Government to take the
first steps towards reconciliation by retracting or toning down the
decrees of 16th and 19th November and 15th December, which
had brought about the crisis. Further, the Convention ought to
have seen through and thwarted the attempt of Lebrun to
regain popularity by insulting Pitt in the report of 18th December.
Had that body been less intent on the party man&#0339;uvres
centring in the trial of Louis&nbsp;XVI, it would assuredly not have
furthered the insidious designs of that Minister. It might have
offered to recall Chauvelin, and to substitute Maret, a man
known to be a <span lang="la">persona grata</span> to Pitt. Finally, in view of the large
concourse of Frenchmen now in London, reckoned at 15,000, the
Executive Council would have done well to say nothing about
the passing of the Aliens Bill, obviously a precautionary measure
called for by the emergency.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>The French Ministers took exactly the contrary course. On
30th December they decided that Chauvelin should demand the
withdrawal of that measure, as contrary to the treaty of 1786;
failing this, France would declare that compact at an end. They
also began to prepare for an invasion of England, on a plan
which came before them on 28th December; and on the last day
of the year, Monge, Minister for the Navy, issued a circular
letter to Friends of Liberty and Equality in the seaports. It contained
passages to the following effect:</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The English Government is arming, and the King of Spain, encouraged
by this, is preparing to attack us. These two tyrannical Powers,
after persecuting the patriots on their own territories, think no doubt
that they will be able to influence the judgment to be pronounced on
the traitor, Louis. They hope to frighten us; but no! a people which
has made itself free, a people which has driven out of the bosom of
France, and as far as the distant borders of the Rhine, the terrible army
of the Prussians and Austrians&mdash;the people of France will not suffer
laws to be dictated to them by any tyrant. The King and his Parliament
mean to make war upon us. Will the English republicans suffer
it? Already these free men show their discontent and the repugnance
which they have to bear arms against their brothers, the French. Well!
We will fly to their succour. We will make a descent in the island. We
will lodge there 50,000 caps of Liberty. We will plant there the sacred
tree, and we will stretch out our arms to our republican brethren. The
tyranny of their Government will soon be destroyed.</p>
</div>


<p>What did the famous mathematician think of this effusion in
the heyday of the Empire, when he became Count of Pelusium
with a Westphalian estate bringing in 200,000 francs a year?
A collection of the frank confessions of the <span lang="fr">ci-devant</span> Jacobins
would form an entertaining volume.</p>

<p>Not the least piquant of them would be the criticisms of a
Breton captain, Kersaint, on the bellicose speech which he
launched at the Convention on 1st January 1793. Admitting
that Pitt really wanted peace, while Fox only desired to abase
his rival, he averred that the Prime Minister would try to arrest
France in her rapid career of land conquest either by a naval
war or by an armed mediation. War, said Kersaint, must result,
were it only from the perplexities of Pitt and the hatred of
George&nbsp;III for the French Republic. France, then, must threaten
to free the Scottish and Irish nations which England had so long
oppressed. The Republic could appeal with telling effect to the
English sailors not to fight against the champions of the Rights
of Man. Further, France need not fear the British Empire; for
it is vulnerable in every sea, on all the continental markets, while
France stands four-square, rooted in her fertile soil. Let them,
then, attack the sources of British wealth which are easily assailable.
"The credit of England rests upon fictitious wealth, the
real riches of that people are scattered everywhere.... Asia,
Portugal and Spain are the best markets for English products....
We must attack Lisbon and the Brazils, and carry an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
auxiliary army to Tippoo Sultan." As for Spain (continued Kersaint)
she could be paralysed by the revolutionizing of Spanish
America&mdash;the suggestion of Miranda to Dumouriez. In fact,
Frenchmen need not fear war with all Governments. Open
enmity was better than neutrality. This war would "regulate the
destiny of nations and found the liberty of the world." Accordingly
he proposed to offer to England either war or an alliance;
to equip thirty sail of the line and twenty-four frigates; and to
form a Committee of General Defence. The Convention assented
to this last and referred the other questions to it.</p>

<p>Thus opened the terrible year, 1793. The circular letter of
Monge and the speech of Kersaint furnished the weather-gauge
for the future. In them we detect the mental exaltation, the
boundless daring, the overwrought conviction of their neighbours'
weakness, which were to carry Frenchmen up to bewildering
heights of glory and overwhelm them in final disaster.
We behold in awful perspective the conquest of Holland, Italy,
and Central Europe, the Irish Rebellion, the Egyptian Expedition,
the war on British commerce, culminating in the Continental
System, with its ensuing campaigns in Spain and
Russia, and the downfall of Napoleon. All this and more can be
seen dimly, as in a crystal globe, in that fateful phrase of Kersaint&mdash;"The
credit of England rests upon fictitious wealth."</p>

<hr />

<p>Turning to the last details that preceded the declaration of
war, we notice that on 7th January Chauvelin, acting on the
order of Lebrun, sent in a sharp protest against the Aliens Bill
as an infraction of Pitt's Treaty of Commerce of 1786. On one
count Chauvelin certainly had a right to complain; for, strange
to say, the Act was put in operation against Talleyrand,
nominally his adviser, and the champion of the Anglo-French
<span lang="fr">entente</span>. The ex-Bishop of Autun penned an eloquent protest,
which apparently had some effect, for he was not expelled until
March 1794.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Far more incisive was Chauvelin's complaint. We
can imagine his feelings when Grenville curtly declined to receive
it.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> At the same time Grenville refused to discuss or explain the
stoppage of certain cargoes of grain destined for French ports.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>His private correspondence with Auckland shows that this
measure was due to the fear that the French would store the
corn for the use of the army that was threatening Holland.
That motive of course could not be disclosed to Chauvelin; and
Grenville declined to explain it at all until the resolutions
arrived at in Paris were clearly set forth.</p>

<p>On Sunday, 13th January, Chauvelin received from Lebrun a
long despatch, drawn up in less provoking terms than the last.
He sought an informal interview with Grenville, which was <span class="ins" title="imdiately">immediately</span>
granted. Grenville's hitherto unpublished account of the
interview may be quoted in full, as it enables us to see the
<span lang="fr">nuances</span> of the situation:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter"><i>Jan. 13, 1793</i>.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>M. Chauvelin as soon as he came into my room began by stating
that he was desirous of explaining that all his steps subsequent to the
date of my letter of Dec. 31 had been taken in consequence of positive
instructions from the <span lang="fr">Conseil Ex&eacute;cutif</span>, given before they had received
that letter. That they had seen in that letter one thing which had been
satisfactory to them, notwithstanding the other things of which they
might complain&mdash;this was the assurance which enabled them to reject
the idea entertained by some persons in France of its being the intention
of the Government here to declare war at all events. Under this
assurance they had authorized him to give to their answer a form which
was not liable to the exceptions which had before been taken. He then
gave me the despatch from M. Le Brun. When I had read it I told him
only that the circumstances were too critical for me to say anything as
to its contents except to refer him to the answer which I should be [<span lang="la">sic</span>]
to give to it.</p>

<p>He then said that there was one other point which he was desirous of
mentioning. That one of the difficulties of the present situation of the
two Countries was the want of a proper channel of communication.
That he himself, from having no access to the King's Ministers, was
frequently unable to give accounts of their real views and intentions.
That he was therefore to desire the permission to see me often <span lang="fr">sous la
m&ecirc;me forme</span> that he had now come [<span lang="la">sic</span>].</p>

<p>I told him that this was a point on which I was unwilling to take
upon myself personally to give him an answer; but that he should have
one; and in order to avoid mistakes I repeated to him the phrase, that
his request was to see me <span lang="fr">sous la m&ecirc;me forme</span>. He said "yes," and that
this was conceived to be a means of arriving sooner at the object of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>being allowed to present to the King the <span lang="fr">lettres de cr&eacute;ance</span> with which he
was charged. As he did not express this quite distinctly, I asked him
again whether I understood him right; that his present request was only
to communicate under the form in which he now came. He again
assented to this, but in doing it threw out that he had <em>almost</em> had direct
orders from the <span lang="fr">Conseil Ex&eacute;cutif</span> to apply for permission to present his
letters. He however expressly assented to my statement that the other
was at present his only request.</p>

<p>Nothing else material passed, except justifications of himself from the
imputation of treating on public business with some persons in this
country with whom he had connections of private friendship and intercourse,
and complaints of the manner in which he was treated in the
newspapers. To neither of these points I said anything.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>
</div>


<p>It is not surprising that Grenville asked for time to consult
his colleagues (probably also the King) before returning an
answer to Lebrun's missive; for, though unobjectionable in form,
it re-affirmed the French claims and justified all the proceedings
of that Government. Lebrun accused the Pitt Cabinet of raising
difficulties of form and of discovering hostile intentions where
none existed. While repudiating the notion of annexing Belgium,
he firmly adhered to the Scheldt decree. France, he declared,
would respond to all appeals which emanated from the general
will of a nation, and he even asserted that she could treat only
with a Government which "is deemed the organ of the general
will of the nation governed." If her efforts for peace failed, she
would fight England with regret but without fear.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>In effect, then, this despatch held out no hope of a reconciliation.
There came with it, however, a long and rambling letter
from Maret to Miles, which was intended partly to threaten,
partly to cajole the Ministry. In its more dulcet passages the
hope was set forth that the Scheldt affair could be settled, and
even that Chauvelin might be replaced by the estimable Barth&eacute;lemy.
Miles, highly elated, hurried to the Foreign Office on
that momentous Sunday, 13th January, and found that a Cabinet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>meeting was proceeding. Pitt came out and cordially received
Maret's note. He returned to the Cabinet meeting (at which,
strange to say, Burke was present) but came out again "furious,
freighted with the bile of the whole Cabinet," and forbade Miles
to have any dealings with the French Executive Council.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>How are we to explain this change from affability to anger?
The impressionable Miles believed that in that hour Pitt capitulated
to Burke and became a man of war. The reader who
takes the trouble to compare Lebrun's note with that of Maret
will probably come to another conclusion, namely, that the
latter seems very like a device to throw the British Ministry off
its guard. The terms of the two notes are widely divergent;
and, in such a case, Pitt naturally accepted that of Lebrun and
scouted that of Maret, as of a busybody or an intriguer. Grenville
objected to this double-dealing;<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> and probably the presence
of Burke at the Cabinet meeting sharpened the demand for its
cessation.</p>

<p>Another explanation of Pitt's fury is possible. Grenville and
he may have received news of the warlike preparations going
on in the French seaports and on the Dutch borders. I have
found no proof of this; but it is certain that by this time they
must have had before them the inflammatory appeal of Monge
to French and English Jacobins as well as the boastful tirade of
Kersaint to the Convention. Having these proofs of the warlike
ardour of the French and of their reliance on British reformers,
how could Pitt and Grenville look on the philanthropic professions
of Maret as anything but a snare, and Miles as his dupe?
Miles had ever been officious. Clearly the time had come to
stop his fussy advances to an unofficial agent, which Lebrun
might once more ascribe to Pitt's secret fear of France.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to discover how far Pitt and Grenville
were at this time aware of the secret designs of the French
Executive Council. On this topic I have found no definite
evidence. It is very unlikely that on 13th January they knew of
the aggressive plans which the Executive Council had formed
three days before. But it is certain that such plans were set
on foot on 10th January. On that day the Executive Council
drew up secret orders for Generals Dumouriez and Miranda.
The former was then at Paris concerting plans for the next
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>campaign, not for the purpose of saving Louis&nbsp;XVI, as he afterwards
stated. Whether he fanned the warlike ardour of the
Executive Council will perhaps never be known. But undoubtedly
on 10th January the Executive Council bade him
order his lieutenant, Miranda, to prepare for the invasion of
Dutch Flanders and Walcheren within twelve days. Furnaces
were to be supplied to the French gun-vessels in the Scheldt
so as to beat off the frigates, whether English or Dutch is not
stated.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Why did not Miranda carry out this plan? Merely because
he had neither stores nor food<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>&mdash;a fact which justifies the British
Government in placing an embargo on the corn intended for
France. Undoubtedly if he had had supplies, Miranda would have
seized the lands at the mouth of the Scheldt, and cut off the
retreat of the Stadholder to his place of refuge, Walcheren. It
will further be observed that these orders were given at Paris
three days after the despatch of Lebrun's and Maret's notes to
London. The design apparently was to amuse England until a
deadly blow could be struck at the Dutch. Auckland, writing
on the 11th at The Hague, expressed to Grenville the hope that
war might be avoided, or, if that were impossible, that the
rupture should be postponed until the Austrians and Prussians
had re-crossed the Rhine. The preparations of the Dutch were
going on with the usual slowness.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Evidently the French Government
counted on their traditional inertia and on the malcontents
in Great Britain and Ireland. The private letters of
Maret, that <span lang="fr">soi-disant</span> friend of peace, breathe full assurance of
victory.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>Grenville of course sent no answer to the last missive of
Maret; but to Lebrun he replied, on 18th January, that his
explanations were wholly unsatisfactory, as they maintained the
right of the Executive Council to annul treaties at will. Until
satisfaction were granted for the aggressions on His Majesty's
ally, he would continue to take all measures needful for their
common safety. The terms of this reply were doubtless due to
the last news received from Paris. On 12th January the arch-intriguer,
Brissot, had fired off at the Convention a warlike
harangue in which he depicted the British Ministry as helpless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>in the midst of a discontented populace and without a friend in
the world. France could therefore easily arouse Ireland and
Scotland to revolt, besides carrying liberty to India.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> On the
following day the Convention ordered the equipment of 30
sail-of-the-line and 20 frigates, and the construction of 25 sail-of-the-line
and 20 frigates.</p>

<p>On his side Chauvelin saw the rupture to be imminent. In
forwarding Grenville's despatch to Lebrun on the 19th he described
his situation in London as intolerable, and added that no
alternative but war was left. His assistant, Reinhard, ended a
letter of that day to Miles with the words "<em>M. Chauvelin
leaves</em>." That resolve must have been strengthened by Grenville's
haughty note of the 20th, stating that no special means
could be taken to protect his couriers and that he must rank
"among the general mass of foreigners resident in England."
On the same day Grenville informed Sir James Murray, who
had gone on a special mission to the Prussian headquarters, that
war was likely to break out, as France "insists on terms entirely
inconsistent with the Government of this country and His
Majesty's dignity and honour." His Majesty is strenuously making
preparations and hopes to concert plans with Prussia and
Austria.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs on 21st January, when
Louis&nbsp;XVI laid his head on the block in the Place de la R&eacute;volution.
The news of this tragedy reached London late in the
afternoon of the 23rd; and the horror which it aroused led to a
demand at the Haymarket that the farce should be put off. On
the advice of the Cabinet George&nbsp;III now intervened. At a
Court held on the morrow at the Queen's House (on the site
of Buckingham Palace) an order was issued that Chauvelin,
as the envoy deputed by Louis&nbsp;XVI, should leave the country
on or before 1st February. But on or before 25th January, that
is, before the news of this mandate can have reached Paris,
Lebrun had decided to recall the French mission from London.
On 25th January he wrote to Monsieur Greenville [<span lang="la">sic</span>] stating
that, as his plenipotentiary, Chauvelin, had orders to return to
Paris, Maret would proceed to London to look after the papers
at the French Embassy. This statement merits attention; for
it shows that Chauvelin's departure was hastened only a day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>or two by the King's command;<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> and further it refutes the oft-repeated
assertion that Maret came charged with offers of peace
to which Pitt and Grenville paid no heed.</p>

<p>It will be well to examine this latter question somewhat
closely. In order to understand the situation at Paris, we must
remember that Dumouriez was at that time hesitating between
an attack on Holland and a pacific mission to England. On
23rd January, while at Paris, he wrote two very significant
letters, one to Miranda, the other to Auckland. In the former
he states: "The Executive Council&nbsp;... has thought of sending me
as special ambassador to England to make that country decide
definitely for peace or war. Consequently <em>an order has been given
for our ambassador, Chauvelin, to return</em>. To-morrow they will
send a secret agent [Maret], very well known to Mr. Pitt and
Mr. Fox, to ask the two parties (that is to say the whole nation)
for a safe-conduct for me and an assurance that I shall be
welcome. As I have to ask for <em>yes</em> or <em>no</em>, like Cato at Carthage,
this mission will not last more than eight days." Pending the
reply to the first question (says Dumouriez) he will set out for
Dunkirk, Bruges, and Antwerp. His second letter, of the same
date, is to Auckland at The Hague, stating that he knows him to
be desirous of peace, as he himself is. Can they not have an
interview on the Dutch frontier, near Antwerp, where he will be
on 30th January?<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Now it is clear from Grenville's and Auckland's correspondence
that Ministers paid some heed to the offer of Dumouriez.
Nothing came of it owing to the arrival of news of the French
declaration of war; but the proposal was at least considered.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
There is not a line to show that Pitt and Grenville took Maret's
so-called "mission" at all seriously. For, in the first place, he
had no powers, no authority to do anything more than collect
the papers of the embassy. He himself gave out to Miles
that he came on a "pacific mission," but he carefully refrained
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>from telling even him what it was.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> His biographer, Ernouf,
has invested his journey to London with some importance by
declaring that on 22nd January he (Maret) drew up and sent off
a "despatch" to Chauvelin, stating that the French Executive
Council desired peace, and that he was coming as <span lang="fr">charg&eacute;
d'affaires</span> to the French Embassy in London. This missive
(whether signed by Lebrun is not stated) met Chauvelin on his
way from London to Dover; but it produced no change whatever
in his plans. He proceeded on his way to Paris, passing
Maret in the night near Abbeville. To assign much importance
to his "despatch" is to overrate both his errand and his position
at Paris. Maret was only one of the head clerks at the French
Foreign Office and had no right to sign official despatches. If
he really was charged by Lebrun to tender the olive-branch, why
was not that despatch sent to London in a form and manner
which would procure credence and have some effect? Again, if
Maret came to restore peace, why did he not at once produce his
powers? The question was infinitely important and undeniably
urgent. Instead of taking decisive action, as any well-wisher of
mankind must have done at so awful a crisis, he declined to
enter into particulars, and, on the plea that Chauvelin was
ordered to Paris (which he himself knew before he left that city)
waited for further instructions&mdash;which never came. Finally
he confessed to Miles that he came to prepare the way for
Dumouriez and to discover whether that general would be
assured of personal safety if he came to England.</p>


<p class="poem" lang="la" style="font-style: normal">
Parturiunt montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.
</p>


<p>Such must have been the thought of Miles, when he heard
this singular admission. For what trust could be placed in
Dumouriez, whose conquest of Belgium&mdash;the source of the
present difficulties&mdash;had by no means sated his desire for its
natural sequel, the conquest of Holland? That Maret had
credentials of some kind may be admitted; for he showed them
to Miles and claimed to be <span lang="fr">charg&eacute; d'affaires</span>; but, as Miles found
his powers to be "extremely limited,"<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> we may doubt whether
they extended beyond the collection and transport of the
archives of Portman Square. If he had any authority to treat
with our Government, it is curious that he refrained from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>doing so merely on the ground of Chauvelin's departure.
"Apprehensive that this event might derange what had been
agreed upon, he despatched a messenger with a letter to Lebrun
stating that <em>under the present circumstances, he should not think
himself authorized to communicate with the British Ministers
without fresh instructions</em>."<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the urgency of the case, he received not a
line, not even a newspaper, from Paris during his stay in London.
In fact, the <span lang="fr">soi-disant "charg&eacute; d'affaires"</span> of France knew so little
of the real state of affairs that he assured Miles of the desire of
his countrymen to give up Nice, Mainz, Worms, the Rhineland,
the Scheldt, and the Low Countries<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>&mdash;at the very time
(31st January) when Danton carried unanimously a decree annexing
the Low Countries to the French Republic.</p>

<p>The explanation of the silence of Maret and the ambiguous
conduct of Dumouriez may be found in the Memoirs of the
latter. He states that a proposal came up in the French Executive
Council at Paris on 22nd January to send him to London;
but it was negatived by three votes to two. Nevertheless,
he arranged with the minority (Lebrun and Garat) that he
should go to Antwerp and have <span lang="fr">pourparlers</span> with Auckland preparatory
to a mission to England, while Maret returned to
London to pave the way for him.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> The scheme was a private
venture, proposed by Dumouriez, and favoured only by the
minority of the Council. In such a case neither Dumouriez nor
Maret could be invested with official functions; and it was only a
last despairing effort for peace that led Maret to pose as a <span lang="fr">charg&eacute;
d'affaires</span> and write to Paris for "fresh instructions." This
praiseworthy device did not altogether impose even on Miles,
who clearly was puzzled by the air of mystery that his friend
assumed.</p>

<p>In view of the facts now set forth, can we blame Pitt and
Grenville for declining to treat with Maret? He brought with
him no proof that he had any other function than that of taking
over the archives of the French embassy. Grenville stated to
Auckland that Maret's presence caused much dabbling in the
funds, and that his presence was most undesirable if Dumouriez
really intended to treat for peace. Pitt afterwards assured the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>House of Commons that Maret had not made the smallest communication
to Ministers.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Evidently they looked on him as an
unofficial emissary, to which level Chauvelin had persistently
endeavoured to degrade him.</p>

<p>Finally, on 4th February, Grenville ordered Maret to leave
the country. By this time news had arrived from Paris that
France had laid an embargo on British ships in her ports; and
this portended more serious news. By that time the die was
cast. On 31st January Danton carried the Convention with him
in a fiery speech, crowned with that gigantic phrase&mdash;"Let us
fling down to the Kings the head of a King as gage of battle";
then, in defiance of the well-known facts of the case, he urged
the deputies to decree an act of political union with the Belgians,
who were already one at heart with them. On the following
day the Convention confirmed this aggressive action by
unanimously decreeing war against Great Britain and Holland.
By so doing the deputies of France merely endorsed the decision
formed by the Executive Council on 10th January.</p>

<hr />

<p>The outbreak of war between France and England is an
event so fraught with momentous issues to Pitt, to the two
Powers, and to the whole world, that I have striven to set forth
as fully as possible every incident, every misunderstanding,
every collision of interests or feelings, that brought it to pass.
No episode in the development of the nations of Europe is so
tragic as this. That two peoples should, within the space of
nine months, abjure their friendly relations and furiously grapple
in a life and death struggle over questions of secondary importance
leads the dazed beholder at first to grope after the
old Greek idea of <span class="greek" title="at&ecirc;" lang="el">&#7940;&#964;&#951;</span> or Nemesis. In reality the case does not
call for supernatural agency. The story is pitiably human, if
the student will but master its complex details. It may be
well to close our study with a few general observations, though
they almost necessarily involve the risk of over-statement.</p>

<p>Firstly, the position of absolute neutrality which Pitt took up
from the beginning of the troubles in France was extremely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>difficult to maintain amidst the rising passions of the year 1792.
The Franco-Austrian war soon led to a situation in which the
future conduct of the neutral aroused far more suspicion, and
scarcely less hatred, than that of the enemy himself. When
brains reeled with rage against tyrants; when cheeks flushed
at the thought of the woes of Marie Antoinette, correct
neutrality seemed inhuman. In an age that vibrated to the
appeals of Madame Roland and Burke, cold passivity aroused
doubt or contempt. Yet it is certain that Pitt and Grenville
clung to that position, even when its difficulties increased tenfold
with the fall of the monarchy and the September massacres.
Lebrun, on coming into office after the former of those
events, was careful to inform his countrymen that the withdrawal
of the British ambassador was not an unfriendly act,
and that England was making no preparations for war. Later
on he chose to represent Pitt's conduct as persistently unfriendly;
but his earlier words prove the contrary.</p>

<p>Again, was it practicable (as Fox claimed) for Pitt to forbid
Austria and Prussia to coalesce against France? Probably it
was not possible, without bringing Russia and Sweden into the
field on the royalist side. In the excited state of men's minds,
an act so annoying as that of armed mediation would have
widened the circle of war; and, as we have seen, it was the
belief of Pitt and Grenville, in August&ndash;September 1792, that the
continental war might probably end from the inability of the
combatants to continue it. No one at that time foresaw the
easy conquest of Savoy and the Low Countries by the French
troops. In one of the few references to foreign affairs in Pitt's
letters of the month following, we find him stating that if France
conquers and keeps Savoy, a new situation will arise.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> But he
remained passive while the French drove the Sardinian troops
from Savoy; and his whole conduct at this time moved Burke
to indignation, if not despair. So late as 6th November Grenville
expressed to Auckland his firm belief in the policy of strict
neutrality.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>What was it, then, that blighted these hopes? The answer
must be that the French victory of Jemappes (6th November)
and the phenomenally easy conquest of the Austrian Netherlands
speedily brought about a new and most threatening situation.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>It has been usual to say, with Goethe, that Valmy was the
birth of a new age. Far more truly may we say so of Jemappes
and its immediate results. That decisive triumph and the welcome
accorded by the liberated Belgians opened up vistas of
beneficent triumph that set the brain of France in a whirl.
Hence the decrees of 16th November&ndash;15th December, which
tear to pieces the old diplomacy, and apply to astonished
Europe the gospel of Rousseau. In place of musty treaties there
will be Social Contracts; instead of States there will be nations
that will speak straight to one another's heart. They do speak:
English Radical Clubs speak to the heart of France, the Convention;
and Gr&eacute;goire, President of that body, makes answer
that if the rulers of England threaten the delegates and their
comrades, Frenchmen will cross the Straits and fly to their help&mdash;"Come,
generous Britons," he cries, "let us all confederate for
the welfare of Humanity."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> In the new age, then, political life
will be a series of <span lang="fr">tableaux</span> from the gospel of Rousseau. To
the true believer there can be no compromise. Relics of old-world
customs, such as the closing of the Scheldt by the Dutch,
must vanish. Here, as elsewhere, Nature will infallibly guide
men aright.</p>

<p>It was the application of these principles to our ally, the
Dutch Republic, which Pitt refused to accept, especially as their
corollary made for the aggrandisement of France. In his eyes
international law imposed stringent obligations, which no one
State, or nation, had the right to revoke. Old world theories of
life, when rudely assailed at Paris, moved their champions to an
enthusiasm scarcely less keen than that of the Jacobins. Britons
who fraternized with the new hierophants were counted traitors
to their King. Moreover, by a most unfortunate coincidence, the
British Government publicly announced its resolve to support
the Dutch Republic on the very day when the French Convention
passed the first of its subversive decrees. Thus, national
pride came sharply into conflict. Neither side could give way
without seeming to betray alike its principles and its honour.</p>

<p>Personal questions played a baneful part in embittering the
feud. Pitt and Grenville shrouded themselves in their insular and
innate austerity. They judged the English Radical clubs too
harshly; they ascribed to those who congratulated the Convention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
on 28th November treasonable aims which can scarcely
have arisen in England when the addresses were drawn up.
Apart from frothy republican talk, which should have been
treated with quiet contempt, those congratulations contained
no sign of consciousness that France was about to challenge
us to conflict. We may admit that Frost and Barlow showed
great tactlessness in presenting those addresses when friction
between the two nations had already begun; for the incident,
besides stiffening the necks of Frenchmen, gave the Reform
movement an appearance of disloyalty to England which worked
infinite harm. Nevertheless, on reviewing these questions, we
see that Pitt treated the foolish ebullitions of youth as though
they implied malice.</p>

<p>Surely, too, he, and still more Grenville, were unwise in
placing Chauvelin under a political and social ban, which naturally
led him to consort with the bitterest enemies of Government
in order to annoy Ministers here and please his employers
at Paris. A touchy and sensitive nature like Chauvelin's is
usually open to the soothing influences of flattery. Grenville,
however, drove him to open enmity, which finally wreaked its
revenge;<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> for it was Chauvelin's report on the readiness of Britons
to revolt which finally decided the Convention to declare war on
1st February. We may also inquire why the Court of St. James's
did not make clear the course of conduct which it proposed to
take in the future respecting France.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> As outlined in the despatch
of 29th December to Whitworth, it formed the basis of a practicable
compromise. If it could be stated confidentially to Russia,
Austria, and Prussia, why not to France? Probably the objections
of George&nbsp;III to the faintest sign of recognition of the
French Republic<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> account for the fact that these enlightened
intentions remained, down to the year 1800, secret except to
those Powers. But statesmen err when they bury their good
intentions in the secrecy of archives and allow public opinion
to sympathize with the enemy. Here was Pitt's most serious
blunder. At the outset of the struggle, and throughout its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>course, he scorned those tactful arts and melodramatic ways
which win over waverers and inspire the fainthearted. Here he
showed himself not a son of Chatham, but a Grenville. The
results of this frigidity were disastrous. All Frenchmen and
many Britons believed that he went out of his way to assail a
peaceful Republic in order to crush liberty abroad and at home.
History has exposed the falseness of the slander; but a statesman
ought not to owe his vindication to research in archives.
He needs whole-hearted support in the present more than justification
by students.</p>

<p>In this respect Pitt showed less of worldly wisdom than the
journalists and barristers who leaped to power at Paris. Their
chief source of strength lay in skilful appeals to popular passion.
In reality their case was untenable before any calm and judicial
tribunal. But the France of that age was anything but calm
and judicial. It lived on enthusiasm and sensation; and the
Girondins and Jacobins fed it almost to repletion. Unfortunately
Danton, the only man who combined strength with some insight
into statecraft, was away in Belgium while the crisis developed;
and the conduct of affairs rested mainly with Lebrun and his
envoy Chauvelin. It is only fair to remember that they were
thirty and twenty-seven years of age respectively, and had had
just four months and eight months of official experience. In
such a case pity must blend with censure. The frightful loss
of experienced men and the giddy preference for new-comers
were among the most fatal characteristics of the revolutionary
movement. Needing natures that were able, yet self-restrained,
bold, but cautiously bold, it now found as leaders calculating
fanatics like Robespierre, headstrong orators and wire-pullers
like the Girondin leaders, or lucky journalists like Lebrun. To
play to the gallery was his first instinct; and the tottering fortunes
of the Gironde made it almost a necessity. Hence his
refusal and that of his colleagues to draw back a hair's breadth
from the unjustifiable position which they had taken up. Behind
them loomed the September massacres, fatal to two Foreign
Ministers of France; before them shone the splendours of a
liberating crusade. We can scarcely blame men so ardent, so
hard pressed.</p>

<p>But there are some rules of the game which even the most
irresponsible of Ministers must observe. Here both Chauvelin
and Lebrun went fatally astray. Chauvelin's <span lang="fr">pique</span> at the interview<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
which Pitt had with Maret on 2nd December led him flagrantly
to misrepresent that incident, and Lebrun, as we have
seen, reported it to the Convention in such a way as to impute
to Pitt a discreditable and cowardly intrigue. This is the
climax of malice. An envoy and a Minister who scatter such
insinuations are the most reckless of firebrands. By this conduct
both Lebrun and Chauvelin inflamed the passions of their
countrymen. In truth, it was passion, not policy, that made the
war. The charges which they brought against England were of
secondary importance&mdash;her demand for the revocation of the
decrees concerning the Scheldt and the encouragement offered
to malcontents, together with her stoppage of corn ships lading
for France, and her Aliens Bill. Such were the pretexts for the
recall of Chauvelin, which, as we have seen, was decided at Paris
before the Court of St. James's determined to dismiss him.</p>

<p>Another fact comes out clearly from a survey of the evidence
given above, namely, that the execution of Louis&nbsp;XVI was in no
sense the cause of the war. The question turned essentially on the
conduct of France towards our Dutch Allies. Before Louis was
put on his trial Pitt and Grenville had decided that the French
must retract their aggressive decree against Holland, backed up
as it was by a claim to support malcontents in any land. Failing
this, war would have ensued, even if Louis had not been condemned
to death. The tragedy of 21st January made no difference
to the issue; for, as we have seen, the French Government
by 10th January decided to push on its plans against the Dutch
Republic. It is also impossible to attach any importance to the
vague offers of Dumouriez and Maret, at which Lebrun connived
probably so as to be able to say, without committing himself
in the least, that he had done all he could for peace.</p>

<p>We may therefore conclude that the wealth and defencelessness
of the Dutch Netherlands lured on the enthusiasts and
intriguers of Paris to an enterprise the terrible results of which
were unsuspected by them. Nothing is more remarkable than
the full assurance of victory which breathes in the letters of
Dumouriez, the despatches of Lebrun, and the speeches of the
French deputies. Experienced statesmen were soon to stand
aghast at the triumph of the Republican arms; but it fell short
of the hopes of the French politicians. In this boundless self-confidence,
sublime were it not so disastrous, is to be found the
chief cause of war in 1793.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="title spaced">THE FLEMISH CAMPAIGN (1793)</p>

<p class="quote">The war is not only unavoidable, but, under the circumstances of the case,
absolutely necessary to the existence of Great Britain and Europe.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pitt</span>,
<i>Speech of 11th March, 1793</i>.</p>


<p>In this chapter and the <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">following</a>, dealing with phases of the
Great War, the narrative may seem at times to diverge far
from the life of Pitt. But, in truth, his career now depended upon
the issue of this gigantic strife. Therefore an account merely of
his domestic concerns, of the debates at Westminster, or even of
British and Irish affairs, would be a one-sided and superficial
sketch. For in reality his destiny, together with that of Great
Britain and of Europe at large, turned upon the events that unfolded
themselves in Flanders and the Rhineland, at Toulon and
Quiberon, in Hayti, Corsica, and Egypt. As these in their turn
were potently influenced by the policy pursued at Paris, Vienna,
Berlin, and Madrid, we must take a survey, wide but minute,
sometimes to all appearance diffuse, yet in reality vitally related
to the main theme. In order to simplify the narrative, I have
sought to disentangle the strands of war policy and to follow
them severally, connecting them, however, in the chapter entitled
"<a href="#CHAPTER_XII">Pitt as War Minister</a>," which will sum up the results of these
studies on the period 1793&ndash;8.</p>

<p>If proof be needed that Pitt entered upon the French war
with regret, it may be found in the fact that on 5th February
he and Grenville empowered Auckland to discuss the pacific
overtures of Dumouriez. Grenville, it is true, saw in this move
merely a device to gain time;<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and we may detect in the British
reply the sanguine nature of the Prime Minister. But his hopes
ended on 8th February, when news arrived of the declaration of
war by the French Convention against Great Britain and Holland.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Thereupon Pitt entered into the struggle without a shadow
of doubt.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> For him it was always a struggle to prevent the
domination of the Netherlands by France; and we may note, as
a sign of the continuity of that policy, that on it largely depended
the rupture with Napoleon in 1803. Pitt summed up the
object of the war in the word "security." In his view, as in that
of his successor, Castlereagh, national security was wholly incompatible
with the possession of Holland, or even the Belgic
Provinces, by France.</p>

<p>In taking this practical view of the crisis Pitt differed sharply
from George&nbsp;III and Burke. They looked on the struggle as
one for the restoration of monarchy. The King on 9th February
wrote to Grenville that he hoped the war would be the "means
of restoring some degree of order to that unprincipled country,"
and Burke flung into an unquotable phrase his anger that the
war should turn on the question of the Scheldt.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> For the present
the aggressive conduct of France welded together these two
wings of the royalist party; but events were soon to reveal the
fundamental difference of view. Indeed, it coloured all their
opinions about the struggle. Wilberforce reports Pitt as saying
that the war would be a short war, and certainly ended in one or
two campaigns. "No, Sir," retorted Burke, "it will be a long
war and a dangerous war, but it must be undertaken."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> In his eyes
the struggle was one between two irreconcilable principles&mdash;democracy
and monarchy. Certainly the effort to force 25,000,000
Frenchmen back into the well-worn grooves was stupendous.
Further, the great Irishman, with the idealism and chivalry which
invest his nature with so much charm, urged the Allies to
abjure all thought of indemnifying themselves at the expense of
France, and to declare their sole aim to be the destruction of
anarchy and the restoration of monarchy, a course of action
which would range on their side a large number of Frenchmen
and avert all risk of identifying that nation with the regicide
Republic. The new letters of Burke suggest the advantages of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>such a declaration and most justly censure the Allies for avowing
their intention of taking land from France. The old man
saw clearly that by so doing they banded Frenchmen together
for a national effort. In the following pages the thoughtful reader
will notice the disastrous effects of this blunder. Here Burke
stood on strong ground; and Pitt was far from guiltless.</p>

<p>On the general question, however, whether the war should be
for the restoration of monarchy or the attainment of security,
Pitt's position is unassailable. For the mere suspicion that the
Allies intended to impose Louis&nbsp;XVII on France condemned
monarchy in the eyes of patriotic Frenchmen. Only amidst the
exhaustion following on the Napoleonic wars could an intensely
patriotic people accept a king at the sword's point. In the first
glow of democratic ardour absolute destruction seemed preferable
to so craven a surrender. While, then, we join Burke in
censuring the procedure of the Allies, we must pronounce his
advice fatal to the cause which he wished to commend. Further,
his was a counsel of perfection to Austria, England, and the Dutch
Republic. Deeming themselves attacked by France, they were
determined to gain security from the reckless schemes of
aggrandizing philanthropy now in favour at Paris; and, viewing
the matter impartially, we must admit that they were
right. The French having been the aggressors, the three States
justly demanded security at that weak point in the European
system, the Flemish border. Further, as Pitt limited his aims to
the expulsion of the French from the Low Countries, he might
reasonably hope for a speedy peace, the task which he set
before himself being far smaller than that of forcing a king back
on the French nation.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Ultimately the stiffneckedness of Napoleon
brought all the Powers to the latter solution; but no one in
1793 could foresee the monstrous claim for "the natural frontiers"&mdash;the
Rhine, Alps, Pyrenees, and Ocean&mdash;which prolonged the
struggle to the year 1814.</p>

<p>Pitt's optimism will appear not unnatural, if we review the
general situation early in the year 1793. The political atmosphere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
was disturbed by two cyclones, one in the west, the other
in the east, of Europe. That which centred in the French Revolution
seemed to have reached its maximum intensity; and
skilled observers augured from the execution of Louis&nbsp;XVI
a relapse into savage but almost helpless anarchy. The recent
successes of the French in the Rhineland and Brabant were
rightly ascribed to the supineness of Prussia and Austria; and
already the armies of Custine and Dumouriez were in sore straits.
The plunder of the liberated peoples by the troops and by commissioners
sent to carry out the decrees of fraternity had led to
sharp reprisals all along the straggling front from Mainz to
Bruges; and now Danton's decree of 31st January, annexing the
Belgic provinces to France, exasperated that people.</p>

<p>Further, the men in power at Paris had as yet shown no
organizing capacity. The administration of the War Department
by "papa" Pache had been a masterpiece of imbecile
knavery which infuriated Dumouriez and his half-starving
troops. We have heard much of the blunders of British Ministers
in this war; but even at their worst they never sank to the
depths revealed in the correspondence of Dumouriez with Pache.
In truth, both Powers began the war very badly; but France
repaired her faults far more quickly, chiefly because the young
democracy soon came to award the guillotine for incompetent
conduct over which the nepotism of Whitehall spread a decent
cloak. The discovery by the Jacobins of the law of the survival of
the fittest served to array the military genius of France against
Court favourites or the dull products of the system of seniority.</p>

<p>For the present, the misery of the French troops, the immense
extent of their lines, and the singular ingratitude of the liberated
peoples, promised a speedy reversal of the campaign of 1792.
For the re-conquest of Belgium, the Allies now had ready on or
near the Rhine 55,000 Austrians under the Duke of Coburg.
On their right were 11,000 Prussians, under Frederick of Brunswick-Oels,
and 13,000 Hanoverians, destined for Guelderland.
These last were to be paid by the Maritime Powers. In reserve
were 33,000 Prussians, under Hohenlohe-Kirchberg. For the invasion
of Eastern France, Frederick William of Prussia marshalled,
near Frankfurt, a force of 42,000 of his own troops, together
with 14,000 other Germans. Further south was General
Wurmser with 24,000 Austrians. And this was not all. The Holy
Roman Empire promised a force of 120,000, whenever its Translucencies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Bishops, Abbesses, and Knights could muster them;
and further east there loomed the hosts of Russia. If these
forces had been used straightforwardly, France must have been
overborne.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>But the half of them were not used at all. Before the campaign
opened, the eastern cyclone drew to itself the energies
which ostensibly were directed against France. Just one week
before the execution of Louis&nbsp;XVI, five Prussian columns crossed
the borders of Poland. This act aroused a furious outcry, especially
as Frederick William preluded it by a manifesto hypocritically
dwelling upon the danger of allowing Jacobinism to take
root in Poland. Fears of Prussian and Muscovite rapacity had
induced Pitt and Grenville to seek disclaimers of partition at
Berlin and St. Petersburg. Assurances enough were forthcoming.
On 29th January 1793 Markoff sought to convince Whitworth
that no partition was intended.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> But in view of the entire passivity
of Pitt on the Polish Question since his surrender to
Catharine in 1791 the two Powers laid their plans for the act of
robbery which took place a few months later.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>In this they had the rather doubtful acquiescence of Austria,
provided that they furthered the Belgic-Bavarian exchange so
long favoured at Vienna and resisted at Berlin. As we have
seen, Pitt strongly opposed the exchange; but, early in February
1793, Grenville and he heard that the Emperor Francis&nbsp;II
hoped to facilitate the transference of the Elector of Bavaria
from Munich to Brussels by adding Lille and Valenciennes to
his new dominion.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> These tidings led them to adopt a decision
which was largely to influence the course of the war. They
resolved to commit Austria deeply to war with France by
favouring the acquisition of Lille and Valenciennes by the Hapsburgs
provided that they retained Belgium. This, however,
was far from the wishes of that Court, which longed for parts
of Alsace and Lorraine, and viewed Belgium merely as a sop
to be flung to the Elector of Bavaria.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<p>Was there ever a more singular game of cross-purposes?
Austria pursued the war with France chiefly with the object of
gaining Bavaria and parts of Eastern France, Belgium (with
Lille and Valenciennes) being allotted to the Elector uprooted
at Munich. Prussia and Russia promised to abet this scheme
as a set-off to their prospective plunder of Poland; but, obviously,
after securing their booty in the summer of 1793, they had no
interest in aggrandizing the House of Hapsburg. Further,
England entered on the Flemish campaign with motives widely
different from those of Austria. Pitt and Grenville sought to
plant her more firmly at Brussels by girdling her with the fortresses
of French Flanders; but she sought to recover Belgium
only to fling it to the Elector. Finally neither Russia nor the
German Powers cared an iota about the security of Holland.
Their eyes were fixed on Warsaw or Munich. In truth, despite
all their protestations as to the need of re-establishing the French
monarchy, they were mainly bent on continuing the territorial
scrambles of former years. The two aims were utterly incompatible.</p>

<p>In comparison with the motives prompting the actions of
States, treaties are of secondary importance. Nevertheless (to
finish with these wearisome details) we may note that on 25th
March Grenville and Vorontzoff signed at Downing Street a
treaty of alliance whereby Russia promised, firstly, to use her
forces, along with those of England, against France; secondly, to
prevent neutrals from helping France indirectly (a clause which
involved the lapse of the principles of the Armed Neutrality),
and thirdly, to grant to England a favourable commercial treaty.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
Agreement with Prussia and Austria was more difficult, but at
last, on 14th July and 30th August, compacts were signed with
them for military aid in return for subsidies; and in the spring
and summer of 1793 Grenville arranged similar conventions with
Sardinia, Hesse-Cassel, Spain, and Naples. In this haphazard
manner did these States agree to war against France. Their
aims being as diverse as their methods were disjointed, the term
"First Coalition" applied to this league is almost a misnomer.</p>

<p>Before describing the first campaign of the war it will be well
briefly to survey the armed forces of the Crown and the organization
for war. Firstly, we must remember that Pitt had devoted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>great attention to the navy and to the fortification of Portsmouth
and Plymouth. Despite the hostile vote of the House of Commons
in 1785, he had succeeded in finding money enough to enable
the Duke of Richmond to place those dockyard towns
beyond reach of a <span lang="fr">coup de main</span>; and to Pitt may be ascribed
the unquestioned superiority of Britain at sea. Of the 113 sail-of-the-line
then available, about 90 could soon be placed in
commission, that is, so soon as the press-gang provided the
larger part of the <em>personnel</em>.</p>

<p>The state of the army was far less satisfactory. Never, in all
probability, since the ignominious times of Charles&nbsp;II, had it
been in so weak a condition relatively to the Continental Powers.
In the Budget of 1792 Pitt asked merely for 17,013 men as
guards and garrisons in these islands; and he reduced even that
scanty force to 13,701 men for the next six months. The regiments
were in some cases little more than skeletons, but with a
fairly full complement of officers. Nominally the army consisted
of eighty-one battalions; but of these the West Indies
claimed as many as nineteen. India needed nine; and on the
whole only twenty-eight line regiments, together with the Guards
and the cavalry, remained for the defence of Great Britain and
Ireland. Efforts were made in December 1792 to bring in
recruits, but with little effect. The defence of London, the dockyard
towns, and other important posts, depended of course
partly on the militia; 19,000 of that useful force were embodied
early in February. But as the authorities forbore to compel men
to serve in person, there was a rush for substitutes, which naturally
told against recruiting for the Line.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Volunteer Associations were
also relied on for local defence, and for overawing the malcontent
or disorderly elements in the populace. The safety of the coasts
and therefore of the capital rested primarily with the navy; and
for England the war promised to be almost entirely a naval war.</p>

<p>Equally chaotic was the administration for war. Some time in
February 1793 Dundas sent to Pitt a Memorandum respecting
a new arrangement of offices which had been mooted in the
Cabinet. The need of some change may be judged by the fact
that Dundas was Secretary for Home Affairs (down to July 1794),
First Commissioner for India (that is, virtually, Secretary for
India), and Treasurer of the Navy, besides drawing glory and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>profit from his airy duties of Groom of the Stole. What changes
had been proposed does not appear; but Dundas expressed himself
as follows: "First: That I should remain precisely as I am
while the war continues, provided the arrangement takes place
respecting the Groom of the Stole to Lord Chatham, together
with all the consequent changes in other offices. This in my
judgment is by much the best for the public service, and ought
to supersede all other individual wishes." Failing this patriotic
arrangement, Dundas requested that he should have the first
claim for the Privy Seal for Scotland, provided that Lord
Chatham did not take the Stole. He (Dundas) would give up
the latter but retain his office at the India Board and the Navy.
Or, thirdly, if he received the Privy Seal for Scotland, he would
give up his other offices except that at the India Board. This
last plan would involve a large reduction of income, but he preferred
it to the others except the two previously named.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless no change of any importance took place. Dundas
continued to be a portly pluralist, utterly unable to overtake the
work of three important offices, with the conduct of the war
often superadded; and Chatham remained at the Admiralty
until the close of 1794, to the annoyance of all champions of
efficiency. In the course of that year Pitt urged the need of
strengthening both the Admiralty and War Departments; but,
as we shall see, Dundas strongly objected to the creation of a
Secretary of State for War, because his duties would overlap
those of the other Departments, and important decisions must
be formed by the Cabinet as a whole.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> I shall touch on this
question more fully in <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">Chapter&nbsp;XII</a>, but mention it here as a
sign of the mental cloudiness which led British Ministers for the
first eighteen months of the war to plod along with the most haphazard
arrangements known even to that age. The contrast
between the boyish irresponsibility of military management in
England and the terrible concentration of power in the hands of
Carnot at Paris, after July 1793, goes far to explain the disasters
to the Union Jack after the first few months of the war.</p>

<p>The triumph of the French Republic and its transformation into
a military Empire cannot be understood until we probe the
inner weakness of the First Coalition and realize the unpreparedness
of Great Britain. Moreover, as the Allies believed that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>France would speedily succumb, the allocation of the spoil
claimed their attention more than preparations for the hunt.
The unexpected vigour of the French might have undeceived
them. While Coburg was leisurely preparing to drive the levies
of Dumouriez from the district between Verviers and Aix-la-Chapelle,
the latter laid his plans for a dash into the almost
unprotected Dutch Netherlands, where he hoped to find precious
spoils and valuable munitions of war.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Breaking up therefore
from Antwerp on 16th February, the Republicans quickly advanced
towards the estuary known as the Hollandsdiep, while
two other columns marched on Breda and Bergen-op-Zoom. As
Dumouriez had foreseen, the torpor of the Stadholder's forces
was as marked as the eagerness of the Dutch Patriots to welcome
the invaders. Breda fell on 26th February; but he failed to
cross the Hollandsdiep, for there the Sea Power intervened.</p>

<p>On 15th February Auckland begged that the Duke of York
might be sent over with a few battalions. The Ministry at once
answered the appeal. On 20th February seven battalions of the
British Guards were paraded at Whitehall; the Duke of York
announced that the first three would go to Holland, and asked for
volunteers from the other four. The whole line stepped forward.
Huddled on to small transports, the little force reached the Dutch
estuaries in time to thwart the efforts of Dumouriez. Their arrival
heartened the defenders of the Hollandsdiep, and held the French
at bay. Meanwhile Coburg had bestirred himself, and, marching
on Miranda's vanguard on the River Roer, threw it back in utter
rout. Dumouriez, falling back hastily to succour his lieutenant,
encountered the Austrian force at Neerwinden, where the unsteadiness
of the Republican levies enabled Coburg and his
brilliant lieutenant, the Archduke Charles, to win a decisive
triumph (18th March). A great part of the French levies melted
away. The Belgians rose against the retreating bands; and in
a few days that land was lost to France. The failure of Dumouriez
to turn his army against the Convention, and his flight
to the Austrian outposts, need not be described here.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Suffice it
to say that the northern frontier of France lay open to attack.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>An advance in force in the month of April or May might have
ended the war.</p>

<p>But, as we have seen, the Allies were too jealous and too distrustful
to act with the necessary vigour. Austria refused to recognize
the Prussian scheme for the Partition of Poland; and the
North German Power retaliated by withholding its contingent
from the support of Coburg.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> That commander, finding himself
duped by the Prussians, pressed the British and Dutch Governments
to send him succour. To this he had some claim; for it
was the Austrian victory at Neerwinden which saved Holland
from the French; and the best method of protecting that land
was to capture the northern fortresses of France. The Dutch
army numbered on paper 50,000 men; 13,500 Hanoverians
were marching towards Guelderland; 8,000 Hessians were entering
the British service. In such a case it would have been disgraceful
not to assist Coburg in completing his triumph. Thus,
as often happens with British expeditions, the scope of the Duke
of York's operations now greatly widened. His original instructions
of 23rd February ordered him not to move more than
twenty-four hours away from Helvoetsluys. On 19th March, as
the danger lessened, the War Office gave him leave to advance,
moving on the right of Coburg's army towards Antwerp and
Ghent.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>The news of Neerwinden led George&nbsp;III to adopt even
more vigorous measures. True, he disliked Coburg's pressing
demand for help, seeing that no treaty of alliance was formed;
but he permitted the forward move on Ghent, and formulated a
still bolder scheme, that the British, Hanoverians, and Dutch
should advance to besiege Dunkirk; for the capture of that
place would enable a siege-train to be brought easily to the
Austrians for the leaguer of Lille and Valenciennes.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> To Grenville
he expressed the hope that these measures would speedily
end the war.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>The letter is important as showing the great influence of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>King on military affairs. It must be remembered that Pitt,
Grenville, and Dundas (the three leading members of the
Cabinet) had no knowledge of these questions, while that
shadowy personage, Sir George Yonge, Secretary at War, had
no seat in the Cabinet. A more unsatisfactory state of things
cannot be conceived. It tended to subject questions of military
policy to that influential trio, which in its turn was swayed by
the will of the King. According to constitutional custom, the
Cabinet was collectively responsible for questions of war policy;
but it is difficult to say how far Ministers were individually
responsible. Pitt and Grenville certainly influenced the decisions
arrived at; Dundas drew up and signed the chief military despatches;
but the wishes of George&nbsp;III had great weight.</p>

<span class="caption">Seat of war in Flanders.</span>
</div>


<p>In fact, questions of war policy turned largely on motives
other than military. The resolve of the King and his Ministers
to share in the invasion of France sprang not only from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
feelings of military honour, but also from the exigencies of diplomacy.
By the middle of March it was clear that Russia and
Prussia would acquire unexpectedly extensive tracts of Polish
land. Francis&nbsp;II vented his spleen at this rebuff on his Chancellor,
Philip Cobenzl, who was virtually disgraced, while a clever
but unprincipled schemer, Thugut, took his place.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Another unwelcome
surprise was in store. The Emperor had hoped to find
in the Belgic-Bavarian exchange "compensation" for the presumedly
moderate gains of his rivals in Poland. But to this plan,
as we have seen, George&nbsp;III and his Ministers stoutly demurred;
and Grenville held out the prospect of the acquisition of Lille and
Valenciennes in order once more to lay that disquieting spectre.
As it also alarmed some of the German princes, whose help was
needed against France, the Court of Vienna saw this vision fade
away until Thugut hit upon the design of conquering Alsace,
and finding there the means of effecting the longed-for exchange.
Pitt and Grenville, however, clung to the policy of rooting
Austria firmly at Brussels, with Lille and Valenciennes as her
outworks, and this involved the effort of winning those two
fortresses for the Hapsburgs. Thugut suggested that, if Austria
could not secure French Flanders, she must find compensation
elsewhere; and he declined to satisfy Eden's curiosity on this
threatening word.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> It therefore behoved us to strengthen
Austria's stroke at French Flanders, especially as she now
acquiesced in the British contention, that the Allies should
neither interfere with the form of Government in France nor
recognize the Comte de Provence as Regent.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>The British Government, however, moved forward its troops
into Flanders reluctantly, firstly, because it wanted to use them
in the West Indies,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and also discerned the preference of
Frederick William for a Polish to a Flemish campaign. That
monarch and his generals left the Austrians to bear the brunt of
everything on the banks of the Rhine, and also in Brabant. His
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>manner of setting about the siege of Mainz was a masterpiece of
politic delay, in which amorous dalliance played its part.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> When
complaints came from his Allies, he hotly retorted that Coburg
had sent him only 5,000 troops from the northern army instead
of the 15,000 that were promised. The Austrians replied with
no less warmth that Coburg needed those 10,000 men because
he had had no succour from the Prussian force supporting him.
The result was that the Duke of York's corps was thrust into
the part which the Prussian contingent ought to have taken.
Accordingly Pitt and some of his colleagues deemed it preferable,
now that Holland was safe, to withdraw the British
troops with a view to a series of expeditions against the coasts
and colonies of France. This problem called for a clear and
decided solution. Nowhere do we so much lament the secrecy
of Cabinet discussions as on these questions&mdash;should the meagre
forces of Britain be used on maritime expeditions (their normal
function in war), or form a petty division in the crusade of two
great Military Powers; or, worst of all, should they be parcelled
out in both kinds of warfare?</p>

<p>All that we know is that George&nbsp;III, on 29th March, strongly
advocated the siege of Dunkirk, in the hope that the capture of
that seaport would assist the Austrians in reducing the fortresses
of French Flanders, and thus put an end to the war. On the
other hand, the Duke of Richmond counselled the withdrawal of
the British force for use against the coasts and colonies of
France; and his two letters to Pitt, dated Goodwood, 3rd and
5th April, show that Pitt inclined to that opinion. The question
was important in view of a forthcoming conference of the allied
commanders and envoys at Antwerp. The letters are too long
for quotation. In that of 3rd April the duke declares that Ministers
must soon decide whether to persevere in Flanders or in
maritime expeditions. "To attempt both is to do neither well."
For himself, he would much prefer to attack Cherbourg, Brest,
l'Orient, Rochefort, Nantes and Bordeaux; but he fears that the
ardour of the Duke of York will lead him into an extensive
campaign in Flanders.</p>

<p>In the second and longer letter, Richmond warns Pitt that, if
he prefers to attack the ports and colonies of France (especially
the West Indies), he ought at once to warn the envoys of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>Allies at Antwerp (who were about to discuss the plan of campaign),
that we could not long afford succour to them, and
trusted that after six weeks they could do without it, or, at least,
would need it only to a very slight extent. If, he continues,
Coburg and the Prussians demur to this, we must reply that
England was at first no party to the war, and entered into it only
for the defence of the Dutch; that participation in a continental
campaign is so unpopular and ruinous, that we may be compelled
to desist from it; that by means of naval expeditions we can help
the common cause steadily and effectively; and that we are in
no position to act on the Continent because "our army, cavalry
and infantry, consists almost wholly of recruits, no part of which
(men or horses) have been raised two months, and the greater
part of which are at this moment only raising." Further, if we
clearly warn the Allies of our resolve to withdraw our troops,
they cannot complain of it. Pitt should therefore instruct Lord
Auckland to give clear expression to these ideas. Coburg will
then probably argue as to the extreme importance of clinching
the successes already won, and will therefore urge the Duke of
York to besiege Dunkirk, Graveline, and St. Omer, with a view
to drawing him on finally towards Paris. But any such proceeding
is to be resisted. The German Powers will dismember
France; but we, having little military weight, shall probably
gain next to nothing. Far more advantageous will be our
action elsewhere, <span lang="la">e.g.</span>, in the seizure of Cherbourg, Toulon, etc.
Richmond ends by requesting of Pitt the favour of an interview.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>Either the interview did not take place, or the duke's arguments
failed to lower the sanguine spirits of the Prime Minister
to the level of prudence. All the letters of Pitt at that time
exude confidence from every line. He hopes that Dumouriez
will succeed in overthrowing the regicides at Paris. The backwardness
of the Prussians in supporting Coburg does not deter
him from ordering to Flanders all the available British and
mercenary troops, in order to besiege Dunkirk, and otherwise
help the Imperialists. As if this is not enough, on or just
before 1st April he treats with Malouet, the French envoy from
Hayti, for the transfer of that colony to the British Crown; he
writes hopefully of finding a force large enough to make an
attempt on the French coast; and a little later Grenville mentions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
a Mediterranean campaign. The King, too, in referring
to a recent offer of peace from Paris, writes that the bounds of
"that dangerous and faithless nation" must be greatly circumscribed
before such a proposal can be entertained.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>Thus France is to be attacked in Flanders, on the north or
north-west coast, on the Mediterranean coast and in Corsica, as
well as the West Indies, by an army which musters scarcely
20,000 effectives. In this confidence, which wells forth into five
distinct schemes, is to be found the cause for the Jacobin
triumphs which shattered the First Coalition.</p>

<p>Austria and Prussia were equally puffed up with unreal hopes.
At the conference at Antwerp in the second week of April
occurred the first of the many blunders which helped to rally
Frenchmen around the tricolour. Coburg's promise, in a recent
proclamation to Dumouriez and the French nation, that the
Allies would not make conquests at the expense of France, was
warmly disavowed at the first sitting. Accordingly, a few days
later, Coburg issued a second proclamation, announcing the end
of the armistice and omitting all reference to his disinterested
views. The change of tone speedily convinced the French people
of the imminence of schemes of partition. This it was, quite as
much as Jacobin fanaticism, which banded Frenchmen enthusiastically
in the defence of the Republic. Patriotism strengthened
the enthusiasm for liberty, and nerved twenty-five million
Frenchmen with a resolve to fling back the sacrilegious invaders.</p>

<p>About this time the French Government sent pacific proposals
to London, which met with no very encouraging reception, Pitt
and Grenville probably regarding them as a means of sowing
discord among the Allies, of worming out their plans, or of
gaining time for the French preparations. It is indeed difficult
to believe that they had any other object. After the defection
of Dumouriez and his Staff, France was in a desperate state, and
her rulers naturally sought to gain a brief respite. Grenville
therefore replied that if France really desired to end the war
which she had forced upon England, definite proposals might be
sent to the British headquarters in the Netherlands.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> None
was sent.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the jealousies of the German Powers, the delay of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>Austria in coming to terms with England, and the refusal of
Coburg to define his plan of campaign, paralysed the actions
of the Allies and saved France. As for the British force, it was
too weak to act independently; and yet the pride of George&nbsp;III
forbade its fusion in Coburg's army.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> By the third week of April
the Duke of York had with him 4,200 British infantry, 2,300
horsemen, besides 13,000 Hanoverians (clamorous for more pay),
and 15,000 Dutch troops of poor quality and doubtful fidelity;
8,000 hired Hessians had not yet arrived.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Yet the King and
his Ministers persisted in hoping for the conquest of French
Flanders. The War Office despatch of 16th April specified as
the chief aim of the war the re-conquest of the Low Countries
by Austria, "with such extended and safe frontier as may secure
the tranquillity and independence of Holland." But Pitt and his
colleagues, far from concentrating on Flanders, continued to toy
with expeditions to Brittany, Provence, Corsica, and the West
Indies.</p>

<p>At first they pressed Coburg to consent to the deviation of the
British force towards Dunkirk; and only on his urgent protest
was that ex-centric move given up until Valenciennes should
have fallen. The Austrian contention was undoubtedly right, as
the British Government grudgingly admitted. The Duke of York's
force therefore moved along with that of Coburg towards that
fortress and showed great gallantry in compelling the French to
evacuate the supporting camp of Famars (23rd May). Early in
June the siege of Valenciennes began in earnest. A British officer
described the defence of the French as "obstinate but not
spirited." They made no sorties, and Custine's army of 40,000
men, which should have sought to raise the siege, did not attack,
probably owing to the unsteadiness and apathy of his troops.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
This lack of energy cost him his life; for on 10th July he was
ordered back to Paris and soon went to the guillotine.</p>

<p>At that time the Jacobins were in a state of mind in which
fury and despair struggled for the mastery. The outlook was as
gloomy as before Valmy in September 1792. Bad news poured
in from all sides. The Girondins, after the collapse of their
power on 2nd June, appealed to the Departments, and two thirds
of France seemed about to support them against the tyranny of
the capital. Had not the Jacobins developed an organizing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>power immeasurably superior to that of the moderates, the
royalists, and the Allies, the rule of that desperate minority
must speedily have been swept away. On 12th July the Parisian
Government declared itself at war with the moderates, who now
had the upper hand at Lyons and in neighbouring districts. On
that same day Cond&eacute; (a small fortress north of Valenciennes)
opened its gates. On 22nd July Mainz surrendered to the King
of Prussia; and six days later the Austrian and British standards
were hoisted on the ramparts of Valenciennes.</p>

<p>This event raised to its climax the fury of the Jacobins; and
on 9th August the Convention passed with acclamation a decree
declaring Pitt to be an enemy of the human race. This singular
manifestation of Gallic effervescence came about in the following
way. The Committee of Public Safety having presented a report
on the scarcity of corn and bread, the Convention was electrified
by the doleful recital. In the ensuing debate stories are told of
men disguised as women who practise insidious devices among
the <span lang="fr">queues</span> at the bakers' shops. At once the Convention decrees
that men acting thus while in disguise shall be deemed worthy
of death. A deputy named Garnier then suggests that as this
is clearly a device of the infamous Pitt to increase disorder, it
shall be declared lawful to murder him. Couthon, for once
speaking the language of moderation, objects to this proposal
as unworthy of the Republic, and moves that Pitt be declared
an enemy of the human race. This is at once approved as worthy
of the humanity and dignity of the Convention. The decree,
then, was obviously a device for shelving the stupid and bloodthirsty
motion of Garnier. The whole discussion may be compared
with Pitt's declaration to the House of Commons on
12th February 1793, that the war, though undoubtedly provoked
by France, would never be waged by England for motives of
vengeance, but merely for the attainment of security.</p>

<p>Why at this time the name of Pitt should have driven the
Parisian legislators half frantic is not easy to see. Up to that
time the exploits of the small British force at Famars and
Valenciennes had been no more than creditable; and it was not
till the end of the month that the news of the entry of Admiral
Hood's fleet into Toulon threw Paris into a frenzy. The decree of
9th August therefore has merely a psychological interest. When
tyrants thundered at the gates of the Republic, France needed
some names the mere sound of which sufficed to drive her sons to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
arms. In 1792 it was Brunswick or Cond&eacute;. When they ceased to
be effective, the populace found others first in Coburg and finally
in Pitt. Other names waxed and waned; but that of the son of
Chatham stood fixed in a dull haze of hatred. Thus, by a singular
irony, the very man who in 1786 had branded with folly those
Englishmen who declared France to be our natural enemy, was
now by her banned as the enemy of the human race. And such
he remains for the great majority of Frenchmen. The hasty and
fortuitous phrase of Couthon, which was designed to save him
from the assassin's knife, will doubtless be the permanent catchword,
irremovable by research and explanation.</p>

<p>The ravings of the French Convention would soon have ended,
had not a great organizer now appeared. On 17th August 1793
Carnot entered the Committee of Public Safety, and thenceforth
wielded its limitless powers for purposes of national defence.
He was an officer of engineers, and had eagerly studied the
principles of strategy. Throwing himself with ardour into the
Revolution, he became a member of the National Assembly, and
now was charged with the supervision of the War Department.
At the War Committee he had the help of officers scarcely less
able. Among them Mallet du Pan, in an interesting survey of
French administrators, names D'Ar&ccedil;on as largely contributing
to the French triumphs at Dunkirk and Maubeuge. He calls
him a soul on fire and full of resource.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> But the brain and will
of this Committee was Carnot. His application to work for some
twelve or fourteen hours a day, his hold on masses of details,
and his burning patriotism, enabled him to inflame, control, and
energize Frenchmen until they became a nation in arms. Moreover,
Carnot had the invaluable gift of selecting the best commanders.
True, the Frenchman was not hampered by a monarch
who regarded the army as his own, nor by clogging claims of
seniority. The "organizer of victory" had before him a clear
field and no favour.</p>

<p>The most urgent danger for the Republic soon proved to be
not in Flanders, but in Brittany and la Vend&eacute;e. There <span lang="fr">la petite
noblesse</span> and the peasantry still lived on friendly terms. They
were alike shocked by the expulsion of the orthodox priests and
the murder of the King. Summoned by the Republic to arms in
the spring of 1793, they rushed to arms against her. In la Vend&eacute;e,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>the densely wooded district south of the lower Loire, everything
favoured the defence. The hardy peasants were ably led by that
born leader of men, the chivalrous Marquis de Larochejaquelein,
who had inspired the men of his neighbourhood with the words:
"If I advance, follow me; if I retreat, slay me; if I fall, avenge
me." With him was his cousin, Lescure, not less brave, but of
a cooler and more calculating temper. The ardently Catholic
peasantry of the west furnished as leaders a carter, Cathelineau,
of rare ability and generosity of character, and Stofflet, a gamekeeper,
of stern and vindictive stamp. Nerved by fanatical
hatred against the atheists and regicides of Paris, these levies of
the west proved more than a match for all the National Guards,
whole columns of whom they lured into the depths of the Bocage
and cut down to the last man. As Victor Hugo has finely said:
"It was a war of the town against the forest." At first the forest-dwellers
threatened to overrun the towns. On 11th June they
took Saumur, a town on the Loire, after a desperate fight, and
sought to open communication with the coast and the British
fleet by seizing Nantes. This attempt, however, failed; and it is
generally admitted that they erred in not marching on Paris
after their first successes. After gaining a sure base of operations,
they should have strained every nerve in order to strike at the
heart. And if distance and lack of supplies and equipment
shortened their reach, they might at least have carried the war
into the rich central provinces, on which the capital subsisted.</p>

<p>But the mistake of these poor peasants was venial when compared
with those of the Allies. On the capture of Mainz, Cond&eacute;,
and Valenciennes, the Prussian, Austrian, and British commanders
did not enforce an unconditional surrender, but offered to allow
the garrisons to march out with the honours of war on condition
of not serving against them for a year. A better example of
shirking present problems at the cost of enhanced difficulties in
the future cannot be imagined. By this improvident lenity the
Allies enabled the regicides to hurl fully 25,000 trained troops
against the royalists of the West and deal them terrible blows.
In September and October the Republicans gained considerable
successes, especially at Cholet. Soon the Vend&eacute;an War became
little more than a guerilla strife, which Pitt fed by means of
arms and stores, but not in the energetic manner desired by
Burke and Windham.</p>

<p>These ardent royalists constantly pressed him to help the men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
of Poitou and Brittany, but had to deplore the wearisome delays
which then clogged all military and naval operations. Most
bitterly did Burke write to Windham, early in November 1793,
that Ministers were so eager in seeking to win indemnities
from France that they had hardened the national resistance
of that nation, and meanwhile had not sent a single shipload
of stores to the brave men of Poitou. Of course it was less
easy than Burke imagined to get stores across a sea not yet
fully commanded by the British fleet, and through inlets and
harbours closely watched by the enemy. But the inaction of a
force entrusted to the Earl of Moira for the support of the
French royalists is certainly discreditable to him and to Ministers.
Among them the Duke of Richmond, Master of Ordnance,
distinguished himself by his incapacity and his ridiculous orders.
Another obvious misfit was Lord Chatham at the Admiralty.
But how can we explain the inactivity of four regiments in the
Channel Islands all the summer? Surely they could have seized
St. Malo or the Quiberon Peninsula.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Such a diversion would
have been highly effective. For the Bretons and Vend&eacute;ans, when
supplied with arms, could have marched eastwards and roused
the royalists of Normandy, Maine, and Touraine. With so
potent a foe near to Paris, must not the regicides have been
overborne by Coburg in Flanders? Everything tends to show
that the Republicans feared the royalists of the West more than
the Austrians in the North. But, as will appear in <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">a later chapter</a>,
Pitt and Dundas decided to throw their strength into the West
Indies. On 26th November 1793, Sir John Jervis sailed for that
deadly bourne with 7,000 troops.</p>

<p>Events were soon to reveal the seriousness of this mistake. It
was far more important to strike at Paris through Brittany than
to occupy even the richest of the French West Indies. For a
triumphant advance of the Bretons and Vend&eacute;ans must not only
have lessened the material resources of the Republic but also
have deprived its defenders of one of their chief advantages.
Hitherto the Republicans had been better massed together,
while their assailants were spread over wide spaces. It is a well-known
principle in war that an army operating on an inner
arc, or what are termed interior lines, has a great advantage
over forces spread over the outer circumference. The Allies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>then held the Pyrenees, the Maritime Alps, the Rhine, and most
of Flanders, Brittany, and parts of the South. The defenders,
possessing the central provinces, could mass their units far more
quickly and choose the point on that outer curve against which
they would aim their blow.</p>

<p>This principle was thoroughly understood by Carnot. Near
the centre of the circle he massed the levies that were to save
the Republic, and, confiding them to zealots who were resolved
to conquer or die, he soon had on foot armies which, however
contemptible as units, were formidable from their weight and
their enthusiasm. As in mechanics the mass multiplied by the
speed gives the effective force, so in the campaign of 1793 the
<span lang="fr">lev&eacute;e en masse</span> multiplied by enthusiasm and impelled by the
brain power of Carnot begot a momentum which, when brought
to bear on light, scattered, and almost stationary bodies, proved
to be irresistible. For while Carnot trusted to concentration, the
Allies either sank into inertia, or made ex-centric movements
which ultimately played into their opponents' hands. The Prussians,
after taking Mainz, did little more than rest on their
laurels, their only move being towards Luxemburg. Coburg was
inclined to follow their example on the ground that an advance
to Paris would unite all the French parties against him, while the
siege of the remaining fortresses in the North would allow anarchy
to run riot at the centre.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> The argument is a good example of
political <span lang="fr">finesse</span> applied to a military problem, with disastrous
results. Coburg therefore set about the siege of Quesnoy.</p>

<p>Certainly he could urge in excuse that the British Government
now insisted on the resumption of its favourite plan, the
capture of that nest of privateers, Dunkirk. On receipt of the
news of the surrender of Valenciennes, an order was sent to the
Duke of York to begin the siege of that once important stronghold,
and capture it for Great Britain, though it might be allowed
finally to fall to the Emperor as one of his new Barrier fortresses,
provided that we gained indemnities in other parts of the world.
French and German historians, with their usual bias against
Great Britain, have assumed that she had resolved to keep Dunkirk.
The contrary is proved by the despatches of Dundas to
Murray, and by a letter of Sir Gilbert Elliot whom Pitt appointed
commissioner to regulate affairs at Dunkirk. Writing to Lady
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>Elliot on 10th September Sir Gilbert says: "No further conquests
are to be made in that quarter in the name of Great
Britain, nor is it intended to retain Dunkirk after the peace."<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
A speedy capture of Dunkirk was evidently expected, for the
same despatch ordered that the Hessian corps, some 8,000
strong, then with the Duke, must be held in readiness to depart
to some other destination.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> This referred either to the expedition
in the Mediterranean (soon to be noticed) or to another,
also in course of preparation, against Brittany. The Duke of
York disapproved of the divergence towards Dunkirk, and the
withdrawal of troops from his command.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>We here touch upon the weak side of Pitt's war policy. His
aims at first had been merely to defend England from invasion,
and to use the fleet and as many troops as could well be spared,
to threaten various points along the coast of France and to capture
her colonies. From these comparatively simple aims he
had been drawn aside into a continental campaign, owing to the
desirability of re-establishing Austria firmly in the Pays Bas.
That is to say, a political aim drew him away from the simple
and effective plan of a maritime and colonial war. Or rather it
would be more correct to say that he tried to carry on a limited
continental campaign as well as the coast expeditions which
promised to paralyse the activities of large numbers of
Frenchmen.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Pitt and his colleagues, instead of concentrating
their activities on Flanders, prepared also to harass the coasts
and colonies of France, and to withdraw part of the Duke of
York's force for service in the Mediterranean or the West Indies.
Instructions to this effect annoyed both the duke and Coburg.
Most reluctantly did the latter consent to the divergence of the
British towards Dunkirk; but, as he had already decided to
spend the rest of the campaign in reducing the border fortresses,
the division of forces had none of those appalling results which
Alison and others have detected. The duke's corps, then, turned
off to the right, and, after gaining some successes over bodies of
the French, set about the siege of Dunkirk. If his siege train
had arrived in time, the town would probably soon have surrendered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
But now Carnot was able to utilize some of the forces
raised in the <span lang="fr">lev&eacute;e en masse</span>. By the beginning of September the
French relieving army amounted to 45,000 men under General
Houchard; while the Hessians and Hanoverians covering the
siege operations did not exceed 9,000 men. These made a most
obstinate and skilful defence in the village of Bambeke, and
thereafter at Hondschoote; but the inequality of force was too
great; and they were outflanked and driven back towards Furnes
and Nieuport with the loss of 2,600 men (6th to 8th September).
The garrison also attacked the besiegers and received much
assistance from French gunboats moored near the shore. It was
an unfortunate circumstance that a storm on 1st September had
compelled a British frigate and a sloop to leave their moorings.
Even so, the duke's force beat back their assailants into the
town. But the defeat of the covering army at Hondschoote
placed it between the French, the walls of Dunkirk, and the sea.
Only by a speedy retreat could he save his men; and at midnight
he drew off, leaving behind 32 siege guns and large
quantities of stores.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>At once there arose an outcry against our naval and transport
authorities for not sending a squadron to cover the right flank of
the Duke of York opposite Dunkirk. Elliot reports that the
duke violently censured Richmond, head of the Ordnance Department,
and Chatham, First Lord of the Admiralty, the latter
of whom was universally allowed to be incompetent. Elliot adds:
"I have seen Dundas and Pitt since the bad news. Dundas
seems much dismayed. Pitt tried to carry it off better."<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Certainly
the delay in sending ships and stores was discreditable to
all concerned. But the decisive action was that of Hondschoote,
six miles distant from the coast, and that reverse was due
to the inability of Coburg to spare the reinforcements which
Murray pressed him to send. On its side the French Government
was ill satisfied with the success at Hondschoote. Censuring
Houchard for not pressing his advantage to the utmost and
capturing the duke's whole army, it replaced him by his young
and energetic subaltern, an ex-draper named Jourdan, who was
destined to become one of Napoleon's marshals, while Houchard
speedily went to the guillotine. By these drastic methods France
found leaders who could conquer. For them the inspiring thought
was&mdash;victory or the guillotine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
<p>The news of the failure at Dunkirk shattered Pitt's hope of a
speedy end to the war. That he faced the prospect of a second
campaign with his usual buoyancy appears from some notes
which bear the date 16th September [1793] and are headed:
"Force to be employed in Flanders, or on the coast of France in
the Channel and the Ocean." He proposes to increase 9 regiments
at home to 800 men apiece, to raise 8 new regiments;
and these, along with Guards and troops from Ireland would
number at least 20,000. He also hoped that at least 20,000 more
Austrians and about 25,000 Bavarians would be available for
Flanders, raising the total force in that quarter to 175,000 men.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
These roseate views are apt to provoke derision; but we must
remember that not until the close of the year 1793 did the Republic
put forth her full strength and beat back her enemies at
all points.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to follow in detail the rest of Coburg's
operations in Flanders. Early in September he took Quesnoy,
and then drew together his forces for the capture of the intrenched
camp at Maubeuge. In this he seemed about to succeed,
when Jourdan's relieving force of 60,000 men, handled by
Carnot, drove the Austrians back at Wattignies with much loss,
and thus saved the garrison at Maubeuge, now in dire straits.
On that day, 16th October, the head of Marie Antoinette fell at
Paris.</p>

<p>As for the Duke of York's army, after remaining in a sorry
plight near Ostend, it moved forward to Quesnoy to prolong
Coburg's right; but the retreat of the main body involved his
retirement towards Ostend, near which town he routed some
detachments of French. For a time the Allies gained a few
advantages and recovered lost ground. But the Republicans
more than made up for occasional losses by pouring troops into
Flanders; and, moving under cover of their fortresses, they often
dealt heavy blows. In quality the Austrians and British far surpassed
the raw levies of France; but these, having the advantage
in number and position, could take the offensive along a wide
ill-defended front. Wherever Coburg and the Duke of York
attacked, they gained an advantage, soon to be lost in face of
the gathering masses of the enemy. As Coburg pointed out,
France sent forth another horde to take the place of one which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>perished or melted away; and the Allies rarely had the chance
of taking the offensive. By this last statement he passed sentence
against himself. An able commander, even with inferior forces,
will mass them so as to strike with effect. Pitt and Grenville
continually pressed him to form some plan of action in conjunction
with the Duke of York; but to this he as persistently
demurred.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Is it surprising that Pitt demanded the removal of
Coburg?</p>

<p>The Rhenish campaign, in which Austria took more interest,
also languished owing to the sluggishness of the Duke of Brunswick.
This, in its turn, resulted from political reasons. Frederick
William, in spite of his treaty obligations to England, refused
to move forward until she guaranteed his late gains in Poland
and made further advances of money. Then, too, he felt no
interest in Austria's proposed acquisition of parts of Alsace and
Lorraine. Pitt and Grenville despatched Lord Yarmouth to the
King's headquarters to make a formal protest against the proposed
withdrawal of the Prussian army. Finally, Frederick
William gave the order to advance, but too late to gain the
results which prompt and vigorous co-operation with the Austrians
should have achieved.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> In short, the course of events in
1793 affords the classic example of the collapse of vast and imposing
efforts owing to division of interests and the intrusion of
jealousies and intrigues. Pitt and Grenville did their best to
keep the Coalition united and active; but a Power which granted
only limited help could not impart that unity of design without
which great enterprises come to naught.</p>

</p>


<p>The enterprise destined to develop into the occupation of
Toulon arose out of the negotiations for alliance with
Austria, Sardinia, and Naples. By the first of these England
pledged herself to send a considerable fleet into the Mediterranean,
as an effective help to the military operations then
going on in the Maritime Alps and the Genoese Riviera. Indeed,
the Court of Vienna made this almost a <span lang="la">sine qu&acirc; non</span> of
its alliance. On its side the British Government gained assurances
of military aid from Sardinia and Naples, the former of
those States agreeing to furnish 20,000 troops in return for the
annual subsidy of &pound;200,000.</p>

<p>Here, then, were the foundations of a Mediterranean policy
on which Pitt and his colleagues began to build in the years
1793&ndash;4, with the singular and unforeseen results at Toulon and
in Corsica. Everything favoured some such design. The French
marine was enfeebled by mutiny, and, as the spring of 1793
merged into summer, there came ominous signs of revolt in the
South against the Jacobin faction supreme at Paris. Accordingly
Grenville urged the Hapsburg Court, in return for British
help in Flanders, to assist an expedition of the Allies to the
coast of Provence. The conduct of the Austrian Chancellor,
Thugut, was characteristic. Far from strengthening the Imperial
forces in Italy, he prepared to withdraw some of them for the
Rhenish campaign, now that a British fleet spread its covering
wings over the Kingdom of Sardinia.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>
<p>Nevertheless the British Ministers persevered with their
scheme; but whether they at first aimed at Corsica or Toulon
is uncertain.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Certain it is that Pitt on 19th July proposed to
detach three line regiments from the Duke of York's force
in Flanders and send them to the Mediterranean along with one
brigade of the Hessian corps and a body of W&uuml;rtembergers. He
pointed out that the naval superiority of Hood and the Spanish
fleet in that sea would enable us to strike a telling blow at Provence
if we were helped by Sardinians, Neapolitans, and Austrians
from the Milanese. He admitted the strength of the arguments
in favour of our land forces acting together on one point; but
he added: "What I now mention seems to offer a fair chance
of doing something material in the South [of France], and, if we
distress the enemy on more sides than one, while their internal
distraction continues, it seems hardly possible that they can long
oppose any effectual resistance."<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Pitt wrote thus at the time when Mainz and Valenciennes
were on the point of surrender, and the Bretons, together with
nearly the whole of the South of France, were in open revolt
against the regicide Republic. Equally characteristic of his
sanguine temperament is his Memorandum of 23rd August 1793
as to the allied forces which ought to be available for service
against France in June 1794, namely, 30,000 in Flanders, while
50,000 marched thence on Paris; 50,000 to attack Brest, and as
many more to attack Toulon.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>It so chanced that on that very day the ardour of the Proven&ccedil;aux
brought about a very different situation. The arrival
of Hood's fleet encouraged the moderates to send two Commissioners,
representing the two coast Departments, to seek help
from the British fleet. Thereupon on his flagship, the "Victory,"
Hood drew up a public Declaration that, if the ships-of-war in
Toulon and Marseilles were unrigged and the French Royal
standard hoisted, he would take those cities under his protection,
respect private property and, on the conclusion of peace,
restore the warships to the French monarchy. He then sent to
a Spanish squadron, under Langara, cruising off the coast of
Roussillon, with a request for help. That officer soon had the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>promise of 2,000 Spanish troops, to be detached from the army
invading that province. The Jacobin forces under Carteaux
having crushed the moderates in Marseilles, Hood made for
Toulon, though as yet the Spanish ships were not in sight. He
cast anchor in the outer roadstead on 27th August, and landed
1,500 men near Fort Lamalgue, east of the town. In the afternoon
fifteen Spanish ships arrived, and on the next day landed
1,000 men. On the 28th Hood also issued a proclamation to
the effect that he would hold Toulon in trust only for Louis&nbsp;XVII
until peace should be restored to France.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> To this the Toulonese
assented; the opposition of some of their sailors and troops soon
collapsed; and a detachment of Carteaux' force was easily dislodged
from a strong position near Ollioules, north-west of the
town (31st August). Toulon therefore seemed a sure gain for
the royalist cause.</p>

<p>Yet Pitt and his colleagues were careful not to identify themselves
with that cause. Hood, having implied in his Toulon
proclamation that one of the objects of Great Britain was the
restoration of the French monarchy, Ministers warned him that
"the true ground of the war was to repel an unjust and unprovoked
aggression against His Majesty, and his Allies, and
the rest of Europe, which had been evidently threatened and
endangered by the conduct of France." True, in the course of
the struggle England had supported the French Royalists, and
might find it prudent, especially in view of the events at Toulon,
to assist in restoring monarchy. "But," adds Lord Chatham, "it
is to be considered as arising out of the circumstances and
founded on the considerations which I have stated, and not as
making part of the object for which His Majesty originally took
up arms."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> This gentle rebuke to Hood (an impetuous and
opinionated officer), clearly shows the attitude of the Cabinet
towards that problem. For Great Britain the re-establishment
of monarchy was not an affair of principle, but solely of expediency.
It is also noteworthy that the inhabitants of Toulon
retained the tricolour flag, thus signifying their adhesion to constitutional
royalism as established in 1791.</p>

<p>The fortunes of the Republic now appeared desperate; and
the Allies would certainly have triumphed had they put forth
a tithe of the energy developed by the Jacobins at Paris. With
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>ordinarily good management on the part of Austria, Sardinia,
and Naples, Toulon might have become the centre of a great
royalist movement in the South. That was certainly the expectation
of Pitt; and Langara, the Spanish admiral at Toulon,
expressed to his Government the hope that the war would soon
end with honour.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>No one at first realized the difficulties of the enterprise. The
ramparts of Toulon were extensive; and the outlying forts, from
Lamalgue on the east to Mount Faron on the north, and the
works on the west and south-west, spread over a circumference
of fully fifteen miles. Then again the French royalist committee
in Toulon was somewhat suspicious of the Allies. In truth a
blight seemed to settle on the royalist cause when it handed
over to foreigners one of the cherished citadels of France.
Loyalty to Louis&nbsp;XVII now spelt treason to the nation. The
crisis is interesting because it set sharply against one another
the principles of monarchy and nationality; and the sequel proved
that the national idea, though still far from mature even in
France, had more potency than royalism. A keen-sighted observer
had very forcibly warned the Marseillais against delivering
their city into the hands of the Spaniards, a crime which must
ruin their efforts. Such was the judgement of Bonaparte in that
curious pamphlet "Le Souper de Beaucaire."</p>

<p>Other invisible agencies, those of time and space, told against
the Allies. Despatches sent by Hood were at least eleven days
in reaching their destination, and often far longer. Consequently,
the plans framed at home were always belated. The first tidings
(received on 7th September) found the Cabinet half committed
to another enterprise, that in the West Indies, which Pitt very
reluctantly postponed owing to the drain of troops to Flanders
and Toulon. A further disadvantage was that disputes between
the British and Spanish commanders at Toulon were known at
Whitehall long after they had come to a head; and the final
reports of the sore straits of the garrison led to the despatch to
Cork of orders for the sailing of reinforcements five days after
the evacuation began at Toulon.</p>

<p>In these brisk and giddy-paced times it is difficult to realize
the difficulties which then beset British commanders warring in
the Mediterranean against an enemy who could send news to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>Paris in three days. Now the telegraph has annihilated space;
but then, as in the campaigns of Francis&nbsp;I against Charles&nbsp;V,
the compactness of France and her central position told enormously
in her favour. The defence of Toulon was practicable,
provided that adequate reinforcements arrived in time. As
will soon appear, Pitt urged the despatch of strong reinforcements
from Ireland; and, but for delays due to the want of
transports, things might have gone very differently at Toulon.
He also expected Austria to send succours if only as a means
of protecting her Italian possessions. In truth, if the Hapsburgs
had discerned the signs of the times, they would have taken
steps to defend the Milanese at Toulon. They were destined to
rue their folly.</p>

<p>Further, on 14th September, despite bad news from Dunkirk,
Dundas issued orders that 4,000 Hessians, serving under the
Duke of York, must be withdrawn in order to strengthen the
garrison at Toulon, their place being taken by others hired at
Cassel. On 28th September Dundas added that the artillery
sent for Dunkirk would be withdrawn from Flanders as it was
urgently needed at Toulon. Thus these two expeditions competed
together, and produced a dislocation of plans and ordering
of troops to and fro, which told against success in either
quarter. By 27th October Ministers definitely decided that Toulon,
or la Vend&eacute;e, was a better fulcrum for their scanty forces than
Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Even so, with all these dislocations of the Flemish
plans, Pitt and Dundas relied too much upon Austria; and all
too late found out that she was a broken reed. The Sardinians,
also, lacking due support from the Court of Vienna, were afraid
to denude their borders and therefore sent an inadequate contingent,
despite the fact that they had promised to place 20,000
troops at the disposal of England free from all expense.</p>

<p>Far different was the procedure of the French. Carnot determined
to retake Lyons and Toulon, even if the efforts against
Spain and Sardinia had to be relaxed. Further, on the 16th of
September there arrived at the Republican army west of Toulon
the incarnation of warlike energy and skill. At the bidding of
the Commissioners of the Convention, Napoleon Bonaparte had
come from the arsenal at Marseilles to assist the few artillerymen
then before Toulon. On the 17th he was placed in command
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>of their insignificant siege artillery, and forthwith from the slopes
two miles west of the town he opened fire on the nearest ships.
It is incorrect to claim for him the origination of the plan of sinking
the fleet by a fire from the height behind l'Eguilette; for three
days earlier the Commissioners of the Convention had written
that they would secure a position whence the allied fleet could
be sunk by red-hot cannon-balls; and there was no point but
the high ground behind Fort l'Eguilette which dominated both
the inner and the outer harbours.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> But it may freely be granted
that Bonaparte clinched the arguments in favour of this course
and brought to bear on it that masterful energy which assures
triumph. It was the first occasion on which he crossed the path
of Pitt; and here, as always, he had the advantage of a central
position, and of wielding a compact and homogeneous force
against discordant Allies.</p>

<p>The worst difficulty confronting the defenders of Toulon
remains to be noted. There the Sea Power is at the mercy of
the Land Power. To attempt to defend that city at the head of
its land-locked harbour, dominated by promontories, was to
court disaster unless the fleet had an army to protect it. In
such a case a fleet is a source of danger rather than of safety. Its
true function is to act where it can, either directly or indirectly,
command the land. It operates with most effect against low
and exposed coasts. St. Jean d'Acre affords, perhaps, the best
example of a town at the mercy of a fleet. Portsmouth, Sydney,
Brest, and Toulon cannot be held by an enemy unless he brings
forces sufficient to hold the neighbouring heights. In occupying
Toulon, the Sea Power was virtually putting its head into the
lion's jaw. Only by degrees did the authorities at home understand
this all-important fact. For some time it was veiled from
Pitt; and, as we shall see, the Austrian Chancellor, Thugut,
never did understand it. To those who were on the spot, the
need of occupying the promontory behind l'Eguilette was apparent;
and on 21st September Lord Mulgrave and Rear-Admiral
Gravina led a force to seize the very height on which Bonaparte's
will had already fastened. The Allies crowned it with a temporary
work dignified by the name of Fort Mulgrave. The fortunes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>of Toulon turned on the possession of all the heights commanding
the harbour, but especially of this one.</p>

<p>Even before the arrival of Bonaparte the difficulties of defence
were very great. A British naval officer wrote on the 14th to
Lord St. Helens, British ambassador at Madrid, that the situation
of the little garrison was very critical owing to daily attacks
from the 5,000 French at Ollioules and the same number on the
eastern side. The Allies, he added, could not wholly trust the
French royalists serving with them, and they were glad to send
away on four French sail-of-the-line some 6,000 French sailors
who had bargained to be landed on the Biscay coast. Having
only 1,570 British and 3,460 Spaniards, they could scarcely man
the ramparts and forts, several of which, especially those on
Mount Faron, were not nearly ready. The houses of the town
were far too near to the ramparts; but the Allies dared not
demolish them until reinforcements arrived. Fortunately the
Spanish Admiral, Gravina, was alert, intelligent, and trustworthy;
and Piedmontese were known to be advancing over
the Maritime Alps into the county of Nice. Part of Hood's
fleet was engaged in intercepting the supplies and stores destined
for the Republicans.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>The letter brings out vividly the perils of the garrison, which
must have evacuated Toulon had not reinforcements speedily
arrived. On 26th September Hood wrote that the Allies were
kept in perpetual alarm by the French batteries, which must be
kept under at all risks, until more troops arrived.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Fortunately
the foresight of Pitt and Grenville had provided the means of
backing up operations in the Mediterranean. Apart from the
treaty with Sardinia, there was a compact with Naples, whereby
that Court promised a force of 6,000 men and 12 warships, the
naval expenses being borne by England.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> By 5th October 1,350
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>Sardinian and 4,000 Neapolitan troops arrived, thus enabling
the garrison to hold up against the ever increasing forces of the
Republicans. On the other hand, the fall of Lyons on 9th
October set free large numbers who were available for service at
Toulon. Consequently the troops and seamen of the Allies were
persistently overworked, so that Hood was constrained to hire
1,500 Maltese seamen, to take the place of those serving the
batteries. At first only 750 British troops could be spared from
Gibraltar; but by the end of October, when further help was at
hand, the allied forces (rank and file) stood as follows:</p>

<p>So exacting was the service, and so unhealthy the season (it
cost Bonaparte a sharp attack of malarial fever), that the number
fit for duty did not exceed 12,000.</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare these figures with the estimate
of Pitt which is in the Pitt MSS. (No. 196).</p>

<p>This Force may be estimated (allowing for some deduction) at 30,000
men. To this may possibly be added some Force from Corsica, and
probably early in the spring, an additional body of 11,000 Sardinians,
perhaps also of 10,000 Austrians, and some troops of Baden from
hence. Possibly also a body of Swiss, and in the course of the next
summer (if the expedition to the West Indies is successful) about 4,000
or 5,000 British on their return from the Islands. If 10,000, or 12,000,
Swiss can be secured, it seems not unreasonable to expect that, by the
beginning of next year, there may be an army in the South of France
of near 60,000 men.</p>
</div>


<p>Pitt, then, regarded Toulon as the base of operations in the
South of France so extensive as to deal a decisive blow at the
Republic. The scheme was surely due to the influence of
Bacchus rather than of Mars. For how was it possible to spare
6,200 men from the Duke of York's force, then hard pressed
after its retreat from Dunkirk? The estimate of the Sardinian
contingent was based on the treaty obligations of that Power
rather than on probable performance; while that for the Spaniards
is strangely beneath the mark. How boyishly hopeful also
to suppose that the British forces destined for the future conquest
of Corsica could spare a contingent for service in Provence
in the spring of 1794, and that the nervous little Court of Turin
would send an <em>additional</em> body of 11,000 men far into France.
Thus early in Pitt's strategic combinations we can detect the
vitiating flaw. He did not know men, and therefore he did not
know Cabinets. He believed them to be acting according to his
own high standard of public duty and magnanimous endeavour.
Consequently he never allowed for the calculating meanness
which shifted the burdens on to other shoulders.</p>

<p>The one factor on which he had a right to count was the despatch
of a respectable force of Austrians from the Milanese by
way of Genoa. The Austrian Governor of Milan promised to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>send 5,000 men; but not a man ever stirred.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Hood did not
hear this disappointing news till 24th November.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> He at once
sent off to London an urgent request for succour; and orders
were given <em>on 23rd December</em> (the day after the arrival of the
news) for three regiments to sail from Cork for his relief. Thus
it came about that 12,000 Allies were left unsupported at Toulon
to bear the brunt of attacks of some 40,000 Frenchmen now
directed by a genius. O'Hara, who took over the command on
his arrival on 27th October, at once gave a verdict consonant
with his pessimistic character. Hood wrote on the morrow to
Dundas: "General O'Hara has just been with me and alarmed
me much. He says our posts are not tenable and that we are
in a dangerous situation for lack of troops that can be relied
upon. And, what is very unpleasant, is the conduct of the
Spaniards, who are striving for power here." On 11th November
O'Hara reported that, in the absence of engineer officers, the
forts had been injudiciously constructed; that their garrisons
began to suffer from exposure to the bleak weather; that the
broken and wooded country greatly favoured the advance of
the enemy, and hampered all efforts to dislodge him; that the
Spaniards and Sardinians had no artillery, tools, or camp equipments;
and that the only means of securing Toulon was to have
an army capable of taking the field.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Hood and he therefore
counted the hours for the arrival of 5,000 Austrians from Genoa,
and of troops from England.</p>

<p>The difficulties of the Allies were enhanced by the disputes
which soon arose between the British and Spaniards as to the
command of the garrison. The tactful Gravina having been
badly wounded in driving the French from Mount Faron, Langara
put in a claim that his successor should be commander-in-chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
of the allied forces (23rd October). To this Hood stoutly
demurred, on the ground that he received Toulon in trust before
the Spaniards appeared; and, though it was true that the Spanish
troops outnumbered the British, yet the command of the
Neapolitan and Sardinian contingents belonged of right to the
subsidizing Power. He therefore claimed the supreme command
for General O'Hara. This matter caused much annoyance at
Madrid, where that rankling sore, Nootka Sound, was still kept
open by the all-powerful Minister, Alcudia. Hood's testiness
increased the friction at Toulon. The Spaniards were justified
in claiming equality at that fortress; for only by their arrival
did the position become tenable; and the joint proclamations of
Hood and Langara formed a tacit admission of that equality.
But Pitt early resolved to take a firm stand on this subject. On
17th October, in discussing the instructions for Sir Gilbert
Elliot, the British Commissioner designated for Toulon, he declared
that we must appoint him governor of that town in consequence
of its surrender to us.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>Pitt kept up this stiff attitude, and on 30th November stated
to St. Helens that, as Toulon surrendered to Hood alone
(Langara having declined to share in the original enterprise)
England must appoint the commander-in-chief, especially as she
could not transfer to a Spaniard the command of her subsidized
Allies. The despatch concluded thus: "His Majesty has in no
case any view upon that place different from that which has
been avowed in his name&mdash;that at the conclusion of peace that
port should be restored to the crown of France and that in the
interval it should serve in His Majesty's hands as a means of
carrying on the war and as a pledge of indemnity to him and
his Allies, including the Crown of Spain, whose claim to indemnity
His Majesty has so distinctly avowed."<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>These words were added because the French Royalists and the
Spaniards asserted that England's high-handed conduct at
Toulon arose from her resolve to make of it a second Gibraltar.
The insinuation struck home then, and has been widely repeated.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
But, on the first receipt of the news of the gain of Toulon,
Grenville declared explicitly to the Austrian Court "that whatever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
indemnification is to be acquired by this country must be
looked for in the foreign settlements and colonies of France."<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
As we shall see in later chapters, Corsica and the French West
Indies were the acquisitions aimed at by the Pitt Ministry.</p>

<p>Some colour was given to this charge by the refusal of the
British Government to allow the Comte de Provence, the <span lang="fr">soi-disant</span>
Regent of France, to proceed to Toulon. Grenville even
instructed Francis Drake, our envoy at Genoa, to prevent him
embarking at that port. At first sight this conduct seems indefensible,
especially as the Court of Madrid favoured the Prince's
scheme. It must be remembered, however, that the British
Government had consistently refused to acknowledge the Prince
as Regent, and was now exceedingly annoyed with him for announcing
his resolve to go to Toulon, without first applying for
permission to George&nbsp;III.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> This violation of etiquette prejudiced
his case from the outset. Further, the Royalists of Toulon had
declared for Louis&nbsp;XVII, and a majority of them throughout
France opposed the claim of "Monsieur" to the Regency. The
constitution of 1791 gave him no such right on his own initiative;
and, as Toulon stood for that constitution, not for the "pure"
royalism which he now championed, his arrival would place the
garrison "at the discretion of wild and hot-headed emigrants
and expose them to the reproaches and discontents of the Regent's
Court."<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Besides, what could the Regent of France do in Toulon,
a town closely besieged and in danger of being taken? His
dignity and influence would be far better maintained by remaining
at large than by proceeding thither.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>Finally, the two princes had given no assurance or promise
that they would recognize the claims of the Allies to indemnities
from France for the expenses of the war.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> On this last matter
the <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span> were beginning to raise shrill protests at London;
and it was certainly wise to come to some understanding with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>the princes on this point before they were put in possession of
Provence. Pitt and Grenville were not made of the same stuff
as the Ministers in power in 1815, who demanded no return for
the sacrifices of blood and treasure in the Waterloo campaign.
None the less, it is certain that Pitt and his cousin had no
thought of keeping either Dunkirk or Toulon, save as a pledge
for the acquisition of some of the French West Indies and
Corsica.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> This was hinted at plainly in the British Declaration
issued at Toulon on 20th November:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>That altho' at the conclusion of peace, we shall think ourselves
entitled to stipulate such terms as may afford just security to ourselves
and our Allies, and a reasonable indemnification for the risks and
expenses of a war in which, without any provocation on our part, we
have been compelled to engage, yet that, for our part our views of
indemnification can only have relation to places not on the Continent
of Europe.</p>
</div>


<p>After this explicit statement, there ought to have been no
bickerings about British aggrandisement at Toulon. Some of
the hot-heads in that town (echoed by Fox later on at Westminster)
chose to consider the Declaration as an infraction of
Hood's promise that he would hold Toulon merely in trust for
Louis&nbsp;XVII. The difference, however was not vital. Pitt and
Grenville intended to hold Toulon merely as a pledge that the
British claims to an indemnity elsewhere would be satisfied.
Spain had most cause for annoyance with the Declaration, inasmuch
as she, though having a superior number of troops in that
town, was neither allowed to consider it as a pledge for her
future indemnities, nor to share in its government. It was confided
to three Commissioners&mdash;Sir Gilbert Elliot, Hood, and
O'Hara, Elliot being virtually Governor.</p>

<p>In one other matter the Courts of St. James and of Madrid
were at variance. The latter urged the need of speedily removing
the French warships from Toulon to a Spanish port, or
of making preparations for burning them. Whereas Pitt, who
regarded Toulon, not as a windfall, but as a base of operations
for a campaign in Provence, maintained that such conduct must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>blight their prospects. With phenomenal stupidity, Langara
allowed his secret instructions on this topic to leak out, thereby
rousing the rage of the Toulonese and the contempt of his
British colleagues. The Duke of Alcudia (better known as
Godoy) expressed sincere regret for this <span lang="fr">b&ecirc;tise</span>. But the mischief
was done. The French royalists thenceforth figured as traitors
who had let in a band of thieves intent only on the seizure of
the French warships.</p>

<p>As if this were not enough, Hood quarrelled with our military
officers, with results highly exasperating to our land forces.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
These last did not shine during the siege. True, in the sortie of
29th November they captured a battery recently erected north
of Malbosquet; but, their eagerness exceeding their discipline,
they rushed on, despite orders to remain in the battery, like a
pack of hounds after a fox (wrote Hood);<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> whereupon the
French rushed upon them, driving them back with heavy loss.
O'Hara, while striving to retrieve the day, was wounded and
captured. His mantle of gloom devolved upon Major-General
David Dundas, a desponding officer, who had recently requested
leave to return on furlough on the ground of ill health and
inability to cope with the work. This general's letters to his
ever confident relative, Henry Dundas, at Whitehall, were always
in a minor key. In his eyes the Spanish troops were "everything
that is bad"; half of the Toulonese were hostile to the
Allies; and the latter were heavily handicapped by having to
defend their own fleets. There was some truth in this; but the
whining tone of the letters, due to ill health, drew from the
Minister a stinging retort, to the effect that the occupation of
Toulon had taken Ministers wholly by surprise; that they had
done their best to comply with the new demands for troops, and
expected their general not to look at his own difficulties alone, but
to remember those of the enemy and endeavour to beat him.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>This was the spirit in which Hood faced the problem. Even
at the close of November, when all hope of the arrival of the
5,000 Austrians was past, he refused to listen to David Dundas's
advice for the evacuation of Toulon; and surely this pertinacity
was consonant with the traditions of the British navy, and of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>army in its better days; but out of this question arose a feud
between army and navy which developed in Corsica with disastrous
results. Ministers strove to send all the succour available.
But they did not hear until 22nd December that the
5,000 Austrians were being withheld. Henry Dundas's letter of
the 28th also breathes deep concern at the news that Sir R.
Boyd had not forwarded from Gibraltar the reinforcements
ordered thence. Further, it appears from an official estimate
drawn up at Whitehall on 18th December, that the troops already
at or ordered to Toulon were believed to be as follows:
British, 2,828; Spanish, 4,147; Sardinians, 2,162; Neapolitans,
8,600. Dundas also included the 1,100 British troops ordered
from Gibraltar (where at that time there was no chance of an
attack), and 2,361 men under directions to sail from Cork, but
which could not stir owing to the non-arrival of the transports.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
The resulting total of 21,198 is, of course, merely a sign of
Henry Dundas's optimism. But obviously Ministers were unaware
of the acute crisis at Toulon at the time of its surrender. In the
age of telegraphy, that disaster would have been averted. The
delays of the Austrians, and the muddles at Gibraltar and Cork,
would have been known betimes.</p>

<p>Strange to say, there was at that time lying at anchor at Spithead
a force under Lord Moira's command, destined for Brittany,
but held back for various causes, which would probably
have turned the balance at Toulon, had Ministers known of the
dire need of reinforcements. It is mortifying to read the letters
of Pitt and the Marquis of Buckingham early in December, complaining
that Moira's force is strangely inactive.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Still more
startling is it to read the hurried order of 23rd December (six
days after the loss of Toulon), that the 40th regiment, then unexpectedly
detained at Cork, though detached for service with
Lord Moira, should set sail at once for the French stronghold
along with the other regiments also detained at Cork.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> What
might not have happened, had those troops set sail for Toulon
before the close of November?</p>

<p>Hero-worshippers will probably maintain that, even if Toulon
had been held harmoniously by all the troops which the imagination
of Pitt and Dundas conjured up, nevertheless the genius and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>daring of the little Corsican would have prevailed. This view is
tenable; but the prosaic mind, which notes the venturesome
extension of Bonaparte's batteries in November&ndash;December,
until they presented their right flanks to the cliffs and their rear
to the open sea, though at too high a level to be cannonaded,
will probably conclude that, if Hood and Langara had had a
force of 20,000 men, they could have driven the French from
those works. As it was, the Allies, not having enough men,
stood on the defensive all along their very extensive front, and
were overpowered at Fort Mulgrave, which was some miles
away from the city. Its garrison of 700 men (British, Spanish,
and a few Neapolitans) was assailed in the stormy night of
16th&ndash;17th December by 7,000 of the best of the Republican
troops. The ensuing conflict will best be understood from the
hitherto unpublished account given by the commander-in-chief.
After describing the heavy cannonade from three French batteries
against Fort Mulgrave, he continues thus:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">H.M.S. "Victory," Hi&egrave;res Bay, <i>Dec. 21, 1793</i>.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>... The works suffered much. The number of men killed and
wounded was considerable. The weather was rainy and the consequent
fatigue great. At 2 a.m. of the 17th, the enemy, who had every advantage
in assembling and suddenly advancing, attacked the fort in
great force. Although no part of this temporary post was such as could
well resist determined troops, yet for a considerable time it was defended;
but, on the enemy entering on the Spanish side, the British
quarter, commanded by Captain Conolly of the 18th regiment, could
not be much longer maintained, notwithstanding several gallant efforts
were made for that purpose. It was therefore at last carried, and the
remains of the garrison of 700 men retired towards the shore of
Balaguier, under the protection of the other posts established on those
heights, and which continued to be faintly attacked by the enemy. As
this position of Balaguier was a most essential one for the preservation
of the harbour, and as we had no communication with it but by water,
2,200 men had been placed there for some time past. On the night
preceding the attack, 300 more men had been sent over, and on the
morning of the 17th, 400 were embarked still further to support it.</p>

<p>When the firing at Balaguier ceased, we remained in anxious suspense
as to the event, till a little before daylight, when a new scene opened
by an attack on all our posts on Mt. Pharon. The enemy were repulsed
on the east side, where was our principal force of about 700 men, commanded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
by a most distinguished officer, the Piedmontese Colonel, de
Jermagnan, whose loss we deeply lament; but on the back of the
mountain&mdash;near 1,800 feet high, steep, rocky, deemed almost inaccessible,
and which we had laboured much to make so&mdash;they found
means once more to penetrate between our posts, which occupied an
extent of above two miles, guarded by about 450 men; and in a very
short space of time we saw that with great numbers they crowned all
that side of the mountain which overlooks the town.</p>
</div>


<p>In this despatch David Dundas proclaimed his own incompetence.
For some time it had been obvious that the Republicans
were about to attack Fort Mulgrave, which everybody
knew to be essential to the defence of the fleet. Yet he took no
steps to strengthen this "temporary post" so that it might
resist a determined attack. He also entrusted one half of the
battery to the Spaniards whom he had declared to be "everything
that is bad." On his own showing, as many as 2,500 allied troops
were near at hand on the Balaguier or Eguilette heights to act
as supports, before Bonaparte's attack began; and 400 more
were sent thither soon afterwards. A spirited attack by those
troops on the victors at Fort Mulgrave on its blind side
might have retrieved the day; but a panic seized part of the
supports, whom Sidney Smith describes as rushing like swine
towards the sea though the enemy was only in a condition to
attack "faintly." Hood was furious at this spiritless acceptance
of defeat; and in his despatch to Whitehall censured the troops
for not making a timely effort;<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> but as David Dundas had all
along opined that the place was untenable, he decided to hold
a council of war. It registered the wishes of the desponding
chief. The officers decided that it was impossible either to retake
the two positions lost, or to establish a post on the outer,
or Cepet, peninsula, capable of protecting the roadstead from
the cross fires which the French would pour in from the Balaguier
and Cape Brun promontories.</p>

<p>During the next three days the evacuation took place amidst
scenes of misery for the royalist refugees that baffle the imagination.
As many as 14,877 were crowded on board the British
ships, together with some 8,000 troops. At the same time Captains
Sidney Smith, Hare, and Edge, with a picked body of men
burnt or otherwise damaged 27 French warships left in the harbour,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
while 18 were brought away by the Allies. Eleven of the
twenty-seven were not seriously injured by the fire, and they
afterwards flew the tricolour. But the loss of 34 warships and
nearly all the masts and other valuable stores was a blow from
which the French navy did not recover until Bonaparte before
his Egyptian expedition breathed his own matchless vigour into
the administration. In ships and stores, then, France suffered
far more heavily than the Allies. Their losses elude the inquiries
of the statistician. They consisted in the utter discredit
of the royalist cause throughout France, the resentment that
ever follows on clumsy or disloyal co-operation, and the revelation
of the hollowness of the imposing fabric of the First Coalition.
In the south of France four nations failed to hold a single
fortress which her own sons had placed in their power.</p>

<p>The Nemesis which waits upon weakness and vacillation has
rarely appeared in more mocking guise than at the close of the
year 1793. About the time when Toulon surrendered, the Austrian
Government finally came to the determination to despatch
thither the 5,000 men which it had formerly promised to send.
Grenville received this news from Eden in the first days of 1794,
shortly after the surrender of the fortress was known. Thereupon
he penned these bitter words: "If the first promise had
been fulfilled agreeably to the expectation which His Majesty
was justified in forming, the assistance of such a body of disciplined
troops would have sufficed to ensure the defence of that
important post; and the injury which the common cause has
sustained on this occasion can be ascribed only to the tardiness
and indecision which so strongly characterize the Austrian Government."<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
Most tactfully he bade Eden refrain from reproaches
on this occasion and to use it merely as an argument for throwing
greater vigour into the next campaign.</p>

<p>Events pointed the moral far more strongly than Eden could
do. As by a lightning flash, the purblind politicians of Vienna
could now discern the storm-wrack drifting upon them. The
weakness of the Piedmontese army, their own unpreparedness in
the Milanese, the friendliness of Genoa to France, and the Jacobinical
ferment in all parts of Italy, portended a speedy irruption
of the Republicans into an almost defenceless land where
they were sure of a welcome from the now awakened populace.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>So long as Toulon held out, Piedmont and Milan were safe.
Now, the slackness of Austria enabled her future destroyer to
place his foot on the first rung of the ladder of fame, and
prompted those mighty plans for the conquest of the Italian
States which were to ensure her overthrow and his supremacy.</p>

<p>Well might Eden dwell on the consternation prevalent at
Vienna early in 1794. For, along with news of the loss of
Toulon, tidings of defeat and retreat came from the Rhineland.
Able and vigorous young generals, Hoche and Pichegru, had
beaten back Austrians and Prussians from the hills around
W&ouml;rth and Weissenburg; so that the Allies fell back with heavy
losses towards the Rhine. Thus, on the whole, the efforts of
Austria, Great Britain, Prussia, Holland, and some of the smaller
German States had availed merely to capture four fortresses,
Mainz, Cond&eacute;, Valenciennes, and Quesnoy. It is not surprising
that public opinion in England, even in loyal circles, became
clamorous against the conduct of the war.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>Not the least of the misfortunes attending the Toulon episode
was that the logic of events, and also the growing savagery of
the Reign of Terror, edged Pitt away from his standpoint of
complete neutrality as to the future government of France.
How could the ally of the Toulonese Royalists profess indifference
on that topic? On 5th October he wrote as follows to
Grenville respecting the powers to be granted to Sir Gilbert
Elliot at Toulon:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>I do not see that we can go on secure grounds if we treat with any
separate districts or bodies of men [in France] who stop short of some
declaration in favour of monarchy: nor do I see any way so likely to
unite considerable numbers in one vigorous effort as by specifying
monarchy as the only system in the re-establishment of which we are
disposed to concur. This idea by no means precludes us from treating
with any other form of regular Government, if, in the end, any other
should be solidly established; but it holds out monarchy as the only
one from which we expect any good, and in favour of which we are
disposed to enter into concert.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>
</div>


<p>These words are remarkable. Clearly, in Pitt's view of things,
"security" for England and Holland was the paramount aim;
but he was beginning to feel that the Republican groups which
scrambled to power at Paris over the headless trunks of their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>enemies, could offer no adequate security. When the Revolution
began to solidify, as it seemed about to do in 1795&ndash;7, he was
willing to treat with its chiefs; but already he was feeling the
horns of the dilemma, which may be described in words adapted
from Talleyrand's famous <span lang="fr">mot</span> of the year 1814: "Either the
Bourbons or the Republic: everything else is an intrigue." The
Toulon episode, more than anything else, bound France to the
regicide cause, and Pitt, albeit unwillingly, to the irreconcilable
Royalists. Thus the event which brought Bonaparte to the front,
shattered the aim of the Prime Minister to effect merely the
restoration of the Balance of Power.</p>

<p>The outbreak of hostilities often tends to embitter the strife
of parties. Those who oppose war find abundant cause for
criticism in the conduct of Ministers, who in their turn perforce
adopt measures alien to the traditions of Westminster. A system
founded on compromise cannot suddenly take on the ways of a
military State; and efforts in this direction generally produce
more friction than activity. At such times John Bull, flurried
and angry, short-sighted but opinionated, bewildered but dogged
as ever, is a sight to move the gods to laughter and his counsellors
to despair.</p>

<p>The events of the session of 1793 illustrate my meaning. In
view of the notorious sympathy of the Radical Clubs with
France, Pitt proposed a Bill against Traitorous Correspondence
with the enemy. Both he and Burke proved that the measure,
far from being an insidious attack on the liberties of the subject,
merely aimed at enforcing "the police of war." Nevertheless, it
passed only by a majority of one&mdash;a warning to the Ministry
not to proceed further in that doubtful course (9th April 1793).
Pitt had the full support of the House in opposing Grey's motion
for Parliamentary Reform, which was thrown out by 282 votes
to 41. The war spirit also appeared in a sharp rebuff given to
Wilberforce and the Abolitionists on 14th May. The institution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
of a Board of Agriculture (which Hussey, Sheridan, and Fox
opposed as a piece of jobbery) and the renewal of the Charter
of the East India Company were the chief practical results of
that session. But the barrenness of the session, the passing of the
Traitorous Correspondence Bill, and the hardships connected with
the balloting for the militia stirred the Radical Clubs to redoubled
energy; so that home affairs for two or three years centred in
their propaganda and in Pitt's repressive efforts. The development
of a keen political consciousness in the masses is a subject
of so much interest that I may be pardoned for dwelling on it
somewhat fully, with the aid of new materials drawn from the
Home Office Archives.</p>

<p>There we see the causes of unrest. Hunger, hatred of the
militia laws, chafing against restraints entailed by the war, all
conduce to discontent. The newly awakened Caliban is also a
prey to suspicion. He hates foreigners. Yet, either as refugees
or prisoners, they swarm along the south coast (there were
for a time 5,000 prisoners in Winchester). Fishermen are
tempted to help in their escape, and a mariner of Emsworth
is arraigned for treason on this count. Even so far west as
Bodmin the prisoners are numerous and threatening. They
convince many of the townsfolk that England would be better
off as a Republic; and two patriotic ladies in fear and horror
inform Lord Mount Edgcumbe anonymously that Frenchmen
cut a mark round the neck of King George on all coins. The
vicar of Ringmer, near Lewes, reports that the smugglers of the
Sussex coast carry on a regular intercourse with France. In the
Isle of Wight even the French royalists, who are there awaiting
the despatch of Lord Moira's long-deferred expedition to
Brittany, figure as murderous Jacobins. In Bath, too, the mayor,
Mr. Harington, is troubled by the influx of Gallic artists and
dancing-masters, especially as they mix in all the "routs," and
dare even there to whisper treason against King George.
Another report comes that a French usher in a large school near
London&mdash;was it Harrow?&mdash;has converted several of the boys to
republicanism. Clearly, these are cases for the Aliens Act.</p>

<p>Even Britons, untainted by Gallic connections, are suspect. At
Billingsgate a soldier swears that he was set upon at night because
he wore the uniform of "a d&mdash;&mdash;d tyrant"; and other
evidence proves that the service was unpopular for political reasons
as well as the poor pay. Farmers are plied by emissaries of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the clubs as they come in to market. Complaints come to Dundas
that farmers and shippers on the coasts of Lancashire and
Cumberland sell corn to "the natural enemy."</p>

<p>The discontent takes colour from its surroundings. At Pocklington
in Yorkshire the villagers threaten to burn the magistrates
in their houses in revenge for the conviction of poachers.
The rowdies of Olney in Bucks. (formerly a sore trial to Cowper
and John Newton) terrorize the neighbourhood. Everywhere
the high price of corn produces irritation. The tinworkers of
North Cornwall march in force to Padstow to prevent the exportation
of corn from that little harbour; otherwise they are
law-abiding, though a magistrate warns Dundas that local malcontents
are setting them against the Government. Multiply
these typical cases a thousand fold, and it will be seen that the
old rural system is strained to breaking point. The amenities of
the rule of the squires are now paid back, and that, too, at a
time when England needs one mind, one heart, one soul. At and
near Sheffield serious riots break out owing to the enclosures of
common-fields and wastes, the houses of the agricultural "reformers"
being burnt or wrecked. On the whole, however, I have
found fewer references to enclosures than might be expected.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>As generally happens in times of excitement, the towns are
the first to voice the dumb or muttering hatreds of the villages.
Parisians led the Revolution in France, though its causes lay
thickest and deepest in the rural districts. Not until Paris
"stormed" its castle did the villagers attack theirs. So, too, in
the muffled repetition of the revolutionary music which England
sounds forth, the towns buzz, while the country supplies but a
dull ground-tone. Dearness of food and scarcity of work were
the chief causes of discontent. The spokesmen for the Spitalfields
weavers, who number 14,000, sent up a temperate petition
setting forth their distress; but, as is often the case in London,
their thoughts turned not to politics, but to practical means of
cure. They stated that the trade in velvets, brocades, and rich
silks would be absolutely ruined unless steps were taken to revive
the fashion in these fabrics. In Liverpool there were far other
grievances. There, as in all seaports, the tyranny of the press-gang
was sharply resented; and, early in November 1793, the
populace clamoured for the election of a "liberty-loving mayor,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>Mr. Tarleton, who promised to keep the press-gang out of the
town.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>In general the malcontents urged their case most pointedly in
towns and villages, where branches of the Radical Societies had
taken root. These Societies or clubs continued to grow in
number and influence through the year 1793, the typical club
being now concerned, not with faro, but with the "Rights of Man."
Some of the Reform Clubs sought to moderate the Gallicizing
zeal of the extreme wing. Thus, the "Friends of the People,"
whose subscription of two and a half guineas was some guarantee
for moderation, formally expressed their disapproval of Paine's
works and all Republican agencies&mdash;a futile declaration; for his
"Rights of Man" was the very life-blood of the new clubs.
Working men had shown little or no interest in the earlier
motions for Reform. The Associations of the years 1780&ndash;5 had
lapsed; and it was clearly the joint influence of the French
Revolution and Paine's productions which led to the remarkable
awakening of the year 1792.</p>

<p>Besides the London Corresponding Society, started (as we saw
in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter&nbsp;III</a>) by Thomas Hardy early in that year, there
was another formidable organization, the Society for Constitutional
Information, founded in London at the close of 1791.
It, too, was concerned with much more than the Reform of
Parliament; for on 18th May 1792 it recommended the publication
in a cheap form of Paine's "Rights of Man"; and on 21st
November it appointed a Committee for Foreign Correspondence.
A little later were adopted some of the phrases used in
the French Convention, and St. Andr&eacute;, Roland, and <span class="ins" title="Barr&egrave;re">Bar&egrave;re</span> were
admitted to membership. It does not appear that either this
Society, or Hardy's, corresponded with France after the declaration
of war; for the Parliamentary Committee of Secrecy,
charged in 1794 to report on seditious proceedings would, if it
were possible, have fastened on so compromising an act. Its
members belonged to a higher class than those of Hardy's
Society; for they included Romney the painter, Holcroft the
dramatist, Horne Tooke, the humorous <span lang="fr">litt&eacute;rateur</span>, and Thelwall,
the ablest lecturer of the day.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> That these men had
advanced far beyond the standpoint of the Whiggish "Friends
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>of the People," appears from a letter from one of the Norwich
Radical Clubs to the London Corresponding Society:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>The Friends of the People mean only a partial Reform, because they
leave out words expressing the Duke of Richmond's plan and talk only
of a Reform; while the Manchester people seem to intimate, by addressing
Mr. Paine, as though they were intent upon Republican principles
only. Now, to come closer to the main question, it is only
desired to know whether the generality of the Societies mean to rest
satisfied with the Duke of Richmond's plan only, or whether it is their
private design to rip up monarchy by the roots and place democracy in
its stead.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>
</div>


<p>These Societies seem to have put forth no definite programme.
Their defenders claimed that they adhered to the Westminster
programme of 1780, championed by Fox and the Duke of Richmond.
But Fox strongly disapproved of their aims, and even
refused to present their petition for annual parliaments and
universal suffrage.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> In truth, the actions of these bodies belied
their words. They largely devoted their funds and their energies
to the circulation in a cheap form of the works of Paine,
200,000 copies being sold in 1793,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> and still more in the following
year. The Societies also adopted methods of organization
similar to those of the French Jacobins Club, and advocated the
assembly of a representative Convention. Every sixteen members
of the London Corresponding Society could form a division; and
the divisions, by the process of swarming-off, rapidly extended the
organization. They also sent delegates who conferred on matters
of importance, either locally or at headquarters; and the head
delegation finally claimed to represent very large numbers in
London and affiliated centres. In the conduct of details Spartan
self-restraint was everywhere manifest. Members were urged to
be brief in their remarks and business-like in their methods.
Officials must give a solemn promise not to skulk, or make off,
owing to persecution; and members were warned that noisy
declamation was not a proof of zeal but might be a cloak for
treachery. Above the chairman's seat was suspended a card with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>the words&mdash;"Beware of Orators." One would like to have
witnessed the proceedings of these dully earnest men.</p>

<p>Both in the provinces and in London, reformers of the old
type sought to curb the more dangerous of these developments,
especially correspondence with the Jacobins' Club at Paris.
Thus, the Manchester Constitutional Society having published
its address of congratulation to that body, together with the
reply of Carras, a member, George Lloyd, entered a formal protest
in these terms: "We are not a Republican Society; but
from such connection and correspondence we shall involve ourselves
in the imputation of Republicanism." He added that their
aim was solely the Reform of Parliament, and with that
foreigners had no concern whatever.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Nevertheless the Society
kept up its foreign correspondence, and received addresses from
Jacobin Clubs in France.</p>

<p>Another threatening symptom was the attempt to excite discontent
among the soldiery. There being then very few barracks,
the men were quartered on the public houses; and several
petitions were sent to Whitehall by publicans (sometimes even
by Corporations), pointing out the many inconveniences of this
custom. Thus in the autumn of 1793 the publicans of Winchester
complained that they had had to lodge as many as
5,000 men during their passage through that city, besides the
Bucks. regiment stationed there, and they begged that barracks
might be built. The authorities paid the more heed to these
petitions because local malcontents "got at" the soldiery in the
taverns, and brought home to them their grievances, namely,
poor pay, insufficient allowance for food at its enhanced prices,
and the severities of discipline exercised by "effeminate puppies"
drawn from aristocratic circles. In particular they circulated a
pamphlet&mdash;"The Soldiers' Friend: or Considerations on the late
pretended Augmentation of the Subsistence of the Private
Soldiers"&mdash;pointing out the close connection between the officers
and "the ruling faction," which "ever must exist while we
suffer ourselves to be governed by a faction."</p>

<p>When the war with France unexpectedly lengthened out,
the Ministry decided to erect new barracks, accommodating
34,000 men, at a total expense of about &pound;1,400,000. In the
debate of 8th April 1796, Fox and General Smith savagely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>assailed this proceeding as fatal to English liberty. "Good
God!" exclaimed Smith, "is every town to be made a citadel
and every village converted into a garrison?" Windham had
little difficulty in showing that the old barracks were in general
badly situated, and not adapted for cavalry. Buildings for the
use of 5,400 horsemen were now erected; and on the whole
question he asserted that the men would live more cheaply, and
would contract less vicious habits than when lodged in inns.
Above all, they would be removed from the sedition-mongers,
who now plied them with doctrines destructive alike of loyalty
and military discipline. Windham then quoted a phrase from
Moli&egrave;re's "M&eacute;decin malgr&eacute; lui": "If I cannot make him dumb,
I will make you deaf."<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> The inference was that the inability of
the Cabinet to silence malcontents involved the expenditure of
&pound;1,400,000 partly in order to stop the ears of the soldiery.</p>

<p>Lord Bacon, in his pregnant aphorisms upon sedition, does not
venture on a definition of that indefinable term. Where, indeed,
shall one draw the line between justifiable discontent and the
inciting of men to lawless and violent acts? We shall notice
presently the claim of a Scottish judge that an agitator may
have good and upright intentions, and yet, if his words and acts
lead to general discontent, he is guilty of sedition and perhaps
of high treason. At the other extreme of thought stands the
born malcontent. He is generally an idealist, having a keen
sense of the miseries of mankind and very imperfect notions as
to the difficulty of peacefully and permanently ending them. In
times of political excitement the statesman has to deal with
large bands of zealots nerved by these irreconcilable principles.
It was the misfortune of Pitt that he sought to hold together
a nation rent asunder by the doctrines of Burke and Paine.
Compromise was out of the question; and yet a British statesman
cannot govern unless the majority of the people is ready
for compromise. His position becomes untenable if, while upholding
the throne, he infuriates all friends of progress; if, when
he seeks to remove abuses, he is dubbed a traitor to King,
Church, and Constitution. And yet, to abandon his post because
of these difficulties is not only cowardly, but also an act of disloyalty
alike to King and people.</p>

<p>As the political thermometer rose towards fever point through
the years 1792&ndash;3, Government kept closer watch upon the political<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Societies; but for a long time Pitt took no action against
them. It seems probable that, if they had confined themselves
to their professed programme (that of the Westminster
Reformers of 1780) he would have remained passive. He did not
prosecute those which in November 1792 congratulated the
French Convention on the triumph of its arms in Belgium and
the advent of a Gallic millennium. What, then, were the developments
which met with his stern opposition?</p>

<p>But, firstly, we must ask the question, Why did not Pitt, in
view of the unswerving loyalty of the great majority of Britons,
rely on the good sense and weight of that mass to overbear the
Jacobinical minority? It is much to be regretted that he did not
take that more intelligent and more courageous course. But
the events of the French Revolution seemed to show the need of
early taking decided measures against a resolute and desperate
group. At half a dozen crises in the years 1789&ndash;92 firm action
would have crushed the anarchic forces in Paris, Lyons, and
Marseilles; but, for lack of a strong guiding hand, those forces
broke loose, with results which all genuine friends of liberty have
ever since deplored. It is perfectly certain that, if Mirabeau
had had a free hand, he would have used coercive measures by
the side of which those of Pitt's so-called "Reign of Terror" would
have been but as a pop-gun to a cannon. Besides, to taunt Pitt
with falseness to his principles of the years 1782&ndash;5 is to ignore
the patent facts that he advocated very moderate changes in the
representation. The Reform movement virtually collapsed in
1785. That which now borrowed its watchwords was in the main
a Republican and levelling agency. The creed of the Radicals
of 1793 was summed up, not in the academic programme of
the Friends of the People, the lineal heir to the earlier Associations,
but in Part&nbsp;II of Paine's "Rights of Man."</p>

<p>Here, surely, are the reasons for Pitt's repressive policy. He
entered on it regretfully, but he felt no sense of inconsistency
in his change of attitude towards Reform. The times had wholly
changed; and that movement changed with them. As Macaulay
has well pointed out, Pitt never declared that, under no circumstances,
would he favour a moderate Reform of Parliament. But
he did declare that in his view Reform was at present highly
perilous; and he resolutely set himself to the task of coercing
those men and those agencies who advocated it in dangerous
forms and by lawless methods.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>
<p>The first prosecution that need be noticed here was directed
against Paine for the seditious utterances in the "Rights of
Man," particularly in Part&nbsp;II. The Attorney-General made
out a formidable indictment, whereupon Paine, then a member
of the French National Convention, informed him that the
prosecution might as well be directed against the man in the
moon, and that the liberties of the people of England were in
reality on their trial. After this impertinence the sentence went
against Paine by default, and that, too, despite a skilful speech
by Erskine (December 1792). The aim of Government of course
was to warn those who were circulating Paine's works that their
conduct was seditious and that they did so at their peril.</p>

<p>The Home Office Archives show that in very many cases the
warning was disregarded, and several prosecutions ensued, with
varying results. Still more frequent were the cases of cursing
the King, sometimes in obscene terms. To these we need pay
no heed. Frequently the offence was committed in taverns by
democrats in a state of mental exaltation. To this exciting
cause we may probably ascribe the folly of John Frost, the
attorney with whom Pitt had some dealings during the Reform
agitation of 1782. He was now charged with exclaiming excitedly:
"I am for equality"; and, when challenged as to the
meaning of his words, he added: "There ought to be no Kings."
In this connection it should be remembered that Frost and
Barlow had on 28th November 1792 presented to the French
National Convention the most mischievous of all the addresses
sent by Radical Clubs to that body. It ended with the statement
that other nations would soon imitate France (that is by
overthrowing the monarchy) and would "arm themselves for
the purpose of claiming the Rights of Man."<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> This piece of
bravado must have told against Frost at the trial; for it proved
that amidst his potations at the tavern he spoke his real mind.
Erskine did his best to defend Frost by quoting Pitt's letters to
him of May 1782, on the subject of Reform.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> The device was
clever; but obviously Pitt's association with Frost for strictly constitutional
purposes in 1782 could not excuse the seditious language
of the latter under wholly different conditions eleven years later.
Frost was condemned to six months' imprisonment in Newgate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>and was struck off the roll of attorneys.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Other noteworthy
trials ensued, notably that of the "Morning Chronicle" newspaper,
which ended in an acquittal; but it will be well now to
turn to the important developments taking place north of the
Tweed.</p>

<hr />

<p>Scotland had now thrown off the trance under which she had
lain since 1745; and her chief towns bade fair to outbid London,
Leeds, Sheffield, and Norwich as centres of democratic activity.
There was every reason why she should awake. She had very
little influence in Parliament. She returned 45 members as
against Cornwall's 44; while the total number of persons
entitled to vote for the fifteen representatives of the Scottish
burghs was 1,303,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> a number smaller than that of the electors of
the city of Westminster. This singular system was defended
chiefly on the ground of the turbulence of the national character.
Even in 1831 a Scottish member declared that Scots could never
assemble without drawing blood; and one of their champions,
Lord Cockburn, made the quaint admission: "The Scots are bad
mobbers. They are too serious at it. They never joke, and they
throw stones." It did not occur to that generation that the cure
for this bloodthirsty seriousness was frequent public meetings,
not no meetings at all. That a high-spirited people should so
long have remained in political childhood seems incredible, until
we remember that a borough election like that of Westminster
was absolutely unknown in the whole course of Scottish history.
Further, it was notorious that the 45 Scottish members were
the most obedient group of placemen in the House of Commons;
and their docility had increased under the bountiful sway of
Henry Dundas, whose control of patronage sufficed to keep the
Caledonian squad close to heel.</p>

<p>This political apathy was now to end. The men of Edinburgh,
Glasgow, and Dundee began to discuss the "Rights of Man,"
and to follow the lead given by the London Corresponding
Society. Thus, on 3rd October 1792, Lieutenant-Colonel William
Dalrymple presided over the first meeting of "The Associated
Friends of the Constitution and of the People," held at Glasgow.
Resolutions were passed in favour of an equal representation of
the people in Parliament, shorter Parliaments, and co-operation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>with "the Friends of the People" in London. The entrance and
annual subscriptions were fixed at sixpence and one shilling.
Thomas Muir of Huntershill, an able young advocate, was
appointed Vice-President. Other Societies were soon formed,
and on 11th December there assembled at Edinburgh a General
Convention of Delegates from the Societies of the Friends of
the People throughout Scotland. Its proceedings were orderly,
beginning and ending with prayer. Resolutions were passed
deprecating violence whether in language or action; and the
presence either of Lord Daer or Colonel Dalrymple in the chair
showed that some, at least, of the gentry were for Reform. This
was exceptional. A little later the gentlemen of several towns
and counties asserted their loyalty in flamboyant petitions; and
the farmers of Dalkeith district at their meeting added to their
loyal toasts the following: "May we have no fox in our fold or
greys (wild oats) in our corn."<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Sir Kenneth Mackenzie on
3rd January 1793 informed William Pulteney that in the North
the towns were thoroughly loyal, with the exception of Perth
and Dundee, where certain ministers and writers led the people
astray.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the authorities, notably the Lord Advocate,
Robert Dundas, took alarm; and on 2nd January 1793 Thomas
Muir was brought before the deputy-sheriff of Midlothian. Muir
was a man of highly interesting personality. The son of a
Glasgow tradesman, he had shown marked abilities at school
and at the University, whence, owing to his advanced opinions,
he was forced to migrate to Edinburgh. There, in his twenty-seventh
year, he soon became a leader of the Scottish Reformers,
his sincerity, eloquence, and enthusiasm everywhere arousing
keen interest. Had his good sense been equal to his abilities,
he might have gone far; but events soon showed him to be tactless
and headstrong. He went far beyond the rest of the delegates
assembled at Edinburgh, namely, in bringing forward, despite
the reluctance of the Convention, an Address from the Society
of United Irishmen in Dublin. Their conduct much alarmed
the authorities at Dublin Castle, who adopted stringent precautions.
Muir should therefore have seen, what his colleagues
did see, that any plan of co-operation was certain to irritate
Government. Nevertheless he persisted in bringing before the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>Convention the Irish Address, which strongly pointed out the
need of common action in the struggle for Reform and urged
both peoples to persevere "until we have planted the flag of
freedom on the summit, and are at once victorious and secure."
Further, the authorities accused Muir of circulating Paine's
writings and other pamphlets, including "A Dialogue between
the Governors and the Governed," which contained such sentences
as these: "The law is the general will&mdash;a new order."
"Nations cannot revolt; tyrants are the only rebels." "We will
live without tyrants, without impostors (priests)."<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> The writings
were probably seditious in their tendency;<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> but the evidence
that he circulated them was of the flimsiest character.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Muir left the country, though in no clandestine
manner, while legal proceedings were pending. After a short
stay in London he proceeded to Paris, in order (as he said at his
trial) to try to persuade the French democrats to spare the life
of Louis&nbsp;XVI. The credibility of this statement is lessened by
the fact that he arrived in Paris only the evening before the
King's execution and remained there long after that tragedy.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
A letter from a Scot in Paris, James Smith, to a friend in Glasgow,
which the postal authorities opened, stated that the writer
met Muir in a <span lang="fr">caf&eacute;</span> of the Palais Royal; that Muir did not hear
of his indictment till the evening of 8th February, and would
return to face his trial, though he was loth to leave France, as
he had made "valuable and dear connections." "Mr. Christie
advised me," adds the writer, "to make some little proficiency in
the language before I begin to think of beginning to do anything."<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
Now, as a clique of Britons in Paris had not long before
drunk the toast of "The coming Convention of Great Britain
and Ireland," Government naturally connected the efforts of
Muir with this republican propaganda. His next doings increased
this suspicion. He left France on an American ship which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>landed him at Belfast; he stayed there a few days, and landed
at Stranraer on 31st July, only to be arrested, along with his
books and papers, and sent to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The ensuing trial, held on 30th and 31st August, aroused intense
interest, owing to the eloquence of Muir and the unscrupulous
zeal of the Scottish authorities in ensuring his conviction.
They packed the jury with men who belonged to a loyal Association;
and it is said that the Lord Justice Clerk, McQueen of Braxfield,
welcomed one of them with the words: "Come awa', Maister
Horner, come awa', and help us to hang ane of thae daamed
scoondrels." The trial itself bristled with irregularities; and
Muir, who rejected the proffered help of Erskine and conducted
his own defence, fastened on them so effectively, that at the
conclusion of his final speech the Court resounded with applause.
All was in vain. The jury found him guilty, whereupon the
Court of Justiciary pronounced sentence of transportation for
fourteen years.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>Admiration of the virtues and courage of Muir must not blind
us to the fact that his conduct had been most provocative. His
visit to Paris, on the scarcely credible pretext that he went
thither to save the King's life, his connection with the United
Irishmen, and his stay in Belfast, told against him. Robert
Dundas, in informing his uncle, Henry Dundas, of his arrest,
added: "I have little doubt that, tho' he avows his intention of
coming home to have been a view to stand trial, [that] he is an
emissary from France or the disaffected in Ireland."<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> The Scot
who first advocated common action with the Irish malcontents
should have paid good heed to his steps. Muir did not do so.
Accordingly, though the direct evidence at the trial told in his
favour, the circumstantial evidence weighed heavily against him.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>
At such a time men's actions count for more than their words. It
was the visit to Paris and the dealings with the United Irishmen,
far more than biassed witnesses and the bullying of Braxfield,
which led to the condemnation of this talented youth. For his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>arrest occurred at the time when terror was the order of the day
at Paris, and when the issue of an inflammatory address at
Dundee spread panic in official circles.</p>

<p>Before adverting to this matter, we may note that Muir settled
down by no means unhappily at Sydney, and bought a farm
which he named Huntershill, after his birthplace. It is now a
suburb of Sydney. A letter from the infant settlement, published
in the "Gentleman's Magazine" of March 1797, describes him
and the other Scottish "martyrs"&mdash;Skirving, Margarot, and
Gerrald&mdash;as treated indulgently by the authorities, who allotted
to them convicts to till their lands. Shortly afterwards Muir
escaped, and, after exciting experiences, in which he was
wounded, made his way to France. In Paris, early in 1798, he
published some articles on the United Irishmen, which Wolfe
Tone and other Irish patriots deemed most harmful to their
cause. They therefore remonstrated with him, but received the
reply that he knew Ireland as well as they did, and had the
confidence of the United Irishmen as much as they had. Wolfe
Tone says of him: "Of all the vain obstinate blockheads that
ever I met I never saw his equal."<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Fortunately for his associates,
Muir retired into the provinces and died in the year 1799.</p>

<p>Dundee played a leading part in the democratic agitation. Its
population, consisting largely of poor weavers, suffered severely
in the year 1793 from dearness of food and scarcity of fuel. On
this mass of needy operatives the doctrines of Paine fell like a
spark on tinder. Dundee became the chief focus of discontent
in Scotland. A Tree of Liberty was planted in Belmont Grounds;
bread riots were of frequent occurrence; and Dundas was burnt
in effigy. In the Home Office Archives is a statement that a
local tradesman named Wyllie generously supplied the waistcoat
and breeches: "they was of satin."<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> In July 1793 there appeared
an "Address to the People," dated "Berean Meeting
House, Dundee," which painted the Government in the darkest
colours, and contained these assertions: "You are plunged into
war by a wicked Ministry and a compliant Parliament, who
seem careless and unconcerned for your interest, the end and
design of which is almost too horrid to relate, the destruction of
a whole people merely because they will be free.... Your
treasure is wasting fast: the blood of your brethren is pouring
out, and all this to form chains for a free people and eventually
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>to rivet them on yourselves." On 1st August 1793 a Government
agent found the MS. from which this placard was printed
in the house of a liquor-seller in Edinburgh. It was in the
writing of a minister, Palmer: so were two letters referring to it.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
Robert Dundas therefore sent to have Palmer arrested. In
mentioning this fact to Henry Dundas, he added that Palmer
was "the most dangerous rebel in Scotland." It transpired in
the course of the trial that the address was originally written by
a weaver named Mealmaker, and that Palmer re-wrote it, toning
down some expressions which he thought too strong. Mealmaker
was a witness at the trial, but was not allowed directly
to incriminate himself. The authorities preferred to strike at
Palmer, a man of parts, educated at Eton and Cambridge, who
latterly had officiated as Unitarian Minister at Montrose and
Dundee. Doubtless these facts as well as his association with
the Scottish Friends of Liberty brought on him a sentence of
five years' transportation.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>If the authorities hoped to crush the Scottish movement by
these severities they were disappointed; for it throve on them.
A spy, "J. B.," who regularly supplied Robert Dundas with
reports about the Edinburgh club, wrote on 14th September
1793 that the sentence on Palmer had given new life to the
Association; for, after a time of decline in the early summer,
more than 200 now attended its meetings. On 28th October he
stated that nearly all the Scottish clubs had revived. Dunlop,
Lord Provost of Glasgow, also declared that discontent made
progress every day; that the soldiery were corrupted, and that
there was an urgent need of barracks.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> Indignation also ran
high at London. Evan Nepean wrote to Robert Dundas:
"There is a devil of a stir here about Muir and Palmer." Braxfield's
address to the jury was thus parodied in the "Morning
Chronicle" of 4th March 1794:</p>


<p class="poem">
I am bound by the law, while I sit in this place,<br />
To say in plain terms what I think of this case.<br />
My opinion is this, and you're bound to pursue it,<br />
The defendants are guilty, and I'll make them rue it.<br />
</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, as another Convention had met at Edinburgh,
Robert Dundas wrote to his uncle on 2nd November 1793 strongly
deprecating any mitigation of the sentences. It was therefore
in vain that the Earl of Lauderdale, Grey, and Sheridan interviewed
the Home Secretary and pointed out that the offence of
"leasing-making," or verbal sedition, was punishable in Scots
law only with banishment, not with forcible detention at the
Antipodes.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Henry Dundas informed his nephew on 16th November
that he would refer the whole question back to the Court
of Justiciary, and if it defended the verdict "scientifically" and
in full detail, he would "carry the sentence into execution and
meet the clamour in Parliament without any kind of dismay."<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
Braxfield and his colleagues defended their conduct in an exhaustive
treatise on "leasing-making," which the curious may
read in the Home Office Archives.</p>

<p>What was the attitude of Pitt towards these events? Ultimately
he was responsible for these unjust and vindictive sentences;
and it is a poor excuse to urge that he gave Dundas a free hand
in Scottish affairs. Still, it is unquestionable that the initiative
lay with the two Dundases. If any Englishman exerted influence
on the sentences it was the Lord Chancellor, Loughborough.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
He treated with contempt the motion of Earl Stanhope on 31st
January 1794 for an examination into the case of Muir, when
the Earl found himself in the position which he so much coveted&mdash;a
minority of one. On the cases of Muir and Palmer coming
before the Commons (10th March), Pitt upheld the Scottish
Court of Justiciary in what was perhaps the worst speech of his
whole career. He defended even the careful selection of jurymen
hostile to Muir on the curious plea that though they were
declared loyalists, yet they might be impartial as jurymen. He
further denied that there had been any miscarriage of justice, or
that the sentence on the "daring delinquents" needed revision.
And these excuses for biassed and vindictive sentences were
urged after Fox had uttered a noble and manly plea for justice,
not for mercy. Grey bitterly declared that Muir was to be sent
for fourteen years to Sydney for the offence of pleading for
Reform, which Pitt and the Duke of Richmond advocated twelve
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>years before. They sat in the King's Cabinet: Muir was sent to
herd with felons. This taunt flew wide of the mark. Pitt in his
motions for Reform had always made it clear that, while desirous
of "a moderate and substantial Reform," he utterly repudiated
universal suffrage. If those were his views in 1782&ndash;5, how could
he accept the Radical programme now that it included the absurd
demand for annual Parliaments? None the less Pitt was
answerable for the action of the Home Minister in referring
the sentences back to the judges who inflicted them&mdash;a course
of conduct at once cowardly and farcical. Pitt's speech also
proves him to have known of the irregularities that disgraced the
trials. But he, a lawyer, condoned them and applauded the
harsh and vindictive sentences. In short, he acted as an alarmist,
not as a dispenser of justice.</p>

<p>It is easy for us now to descant on the virtues of moderation.
But how many men would have held on an even course when the
guillotine worked its fell work in France, when the Goddess of
Reason was enthroned in Notre Dame, and when Jacobinism
seemed about to sweep over the Continent? Here, as at so many
points, France proved to be the worst foe to ordered liberty.
Robespierre and H&eacute;bert were the men who assured the doom
of Muir and Palmer. A trivial incident will suffice to illustrate the
alarm of Englishmen at the assembly of a British Convention.
In December 1793 Drane, the mayor of Reading, reported to
his neighbour Addington (Speaker of the House of Commons)
that the "infamous Tom Paine" and a member of the French
Convention had been overheard conversing in French in a public-house.
Their talk turned on a proposed visit to the British
Convention then sitting in Edinburgh. At once Addington sent
for a warrant from the Home Office, while the mayor urged his
informant to hunt the miscreants down. The machinery of the
law was set in motion. A search was instituted; the warrant
came down from Whitehall; and not until the sum of fourteen
guineas had gone to the informant for his patriotic exertions did
the authorities discover that they had been hoaxed.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>The Edinburgh Convention, consisting of delegates of forty-five
Reform Societies, seems to have pursued dully decorous
methods until 6th November, when citizens Hamilton Rowan
and Simon Butler came to represent Ireland; Joseph Gerrald
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>and Maurice Margarot were the delegates from the London
Corresponding Society; and Sinclair and York from the Society
for Constitutional Information which met at the Crown and
Anchor. A Convention of English Societies assembled at
London about the same time, and deputed the four delegates
to join the Edinburgh body and form a British Convention.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
Accordingly, on 19th November, it took the title, "British Convention
of Delegates of the People, associated to obtain Universal
Suffrage and Annual Parliaments." The statement of Margarot,
that the London police sought to prevent his journey to Edinburgh,
should have been a warning to members to measure their words
well. Unfortunately, Margarot, a vain hot-headed fellow, at
once began to boast of the importance of the Radical Societies;
though fluctuating in number, they were numerous in London;
there were thirty of them in Norwich; and in the Sheffield district
their members numbered 50,000. "If," he added, "we could get a
Convention of England and Scotland called, we might represent
six or seven hundred thousand males, which is a majority of all
the adults of the Kingdom; and the Ministry would not dare
to refuse our rights."<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> Butler then declared that Belfast was in a
state of veiled rebellion; Gerrald, the ablest and best educated
of the delegates, also scoffed at the old party system, and said,
"party is ever a bird of prey, and the people their banquet." On
19th November a delegate from Sheffield, M. C. Brown, moved
that the next British Convention should meet near the borders of
England and Scotland. Thereupon Gerrald proposed that York
should be chosen, despite its ecclesiastical surroundings; for (said
he), "as the Saviour of the world was often found in the company
of sinners, let us go there for the same gracious purpose, to convert
to repentance."<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>All this was but the prelude to more serious work. On 26th&ndash;28th
November the Convention declared it to be the duty
of citizens to resist any law, similar to that lately passed in
Dublin, for preventing the assembly of a Convention in Great
Britain; and the delegates resolved to prepare to summon a
Convention if the following emergencies should arise&mdash;an invasion,
the landing of Hanoverian troops, the passing of a Convention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Act, or the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. These
defiant resolutions were proposed by Sinclair; and, as he afterwards
became a Government informer, they were probably
intended to lure the Convention away from its proper business
into seditious ways. However that may be, the delegates
solemnly assented to these resolutions.</p>

<p>Scotsmen will notice alike with pride and indignation that the
delegates of the Societies north of the Tweed adhered to their
main purpose, Parliamentary Reform, until, under the lead of
the men of London, Sheffield, and Dublin, debates became
almost Parisian in vehemence. As reported in the "Edinburgh
Gazetteer" of 3rd December, they gave Robert Dundas the
wished-for handle of attack. Then and there he decided to disperse
the Convention, so he informed Henry Dundas in the
following letter of 6th December: "Last Tuesday's '[Edinburgh]
Gazetteer,' containing a further account of the proceedings of
the Convention appeared to the Solicitor and me so strong that
we agreed to take notice of them. The proper warrants were
accordingly made, and early yesterday morning put in execution
against Margarot, Gerrald, Callender, Skirving, and one or two
others, and with such effect that we have secured all their
Minutes and papers. Their conduct has excited universal detestation."<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
The expulsion took place quite peaceably. The
Lord Provost informed the delegates that it was not their meeting,
but their publications, that led him to intervene. The Chairman,
Paterson, thereupon "skulked off"; but Brown, the Sheffield
delegate, took the chair, and declared that he would not quit it
save under compulsion. The Lord Provost and constables then
pulled him down; and the meeting was adjourned. Events ran
the same course on the morrow, save that the chairman, Gerrald,
was allowed to wind up the proceedings with prayer before he
was pulled down. Thus ended the first British Convention.</p>

<p>The natural sequel was a trial of the leaders, Sinclair, Margarot,
Gerrald, and Skirving. Sinclair turned informer, whereupon
his indictment was allowed to lapse. The others were
charged with attending the meetings of the Convention which,
"under the pretence of procuring a Reform of Parliament,
were evidently of a dangerous and destructive tendency," modelled
on those of the French Convention and with the like aims
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>in view. The charge was held to be proven, and they were severally
sentenced to transportation for fourteen years. The cases
aroused keen interest, in part owing to the novel claims put
forward by the prosecutor and endorsed by the Judges. The
Lord Advocate argued that these men, in claiming to represent
a majority of the people, were in reality planning a revolt; and
Lord Justice Clerk finally declared that the crime of sedition
consisted "in endeavouring to create a dissatisfaction in the
country, which nobody can tell where it will end. It will very
naturally end in overt rebellion; if it has that tendency, though
not in the mind of the parties at the time, yet, if they have been
guilty of poisoning the minds of the lieges, I apprehend that that
will constitute the crime of sedition to all intents and purposes."<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>To find a parallel to this monstrous claim, that sedition may
be unintentional and may consist in some action which the Government
judges by its results, one would have to hark back to the
days of Judge Jeffreys, whom indeed McQueen of Braxfield resembled
in ferocity, cunning, and effrontery. The insolence of
Margarot at the bar to some extent excused the chief judge for
the exhibition of the same conduct on the bench. But in the
case of Gerrald, an English gentleman of refined character and
faultless demeanour, the brutalities of Braxfield aroused universal
loathing. In one respect Gerrald committed an imprudence. He
appeared in the dock, not in a wig, but displaying a shock of
dishevelled hair, a sign of French and republican sympathies
which seemed a defiance to the Court. Nevertheless, his speech
in his own defence moved to its depths the mind of a young
poet who had tramped all the way from Glasgow in the bleak
March weather in order to hear the trial. At the end of the
speech young Campbell turned to his neighbour, a humble
tradesman, and said: "By heavens, Sir, that is a great man";
to which there came the reply: "Yes, Sir, he is not only a great
man himself, but he makes every other man feel great who
listens to him."</p>

<p>In truth, the Scottish trials were a moral defeat for Pitt and
his colleagues. Sympathy with the prisoners and detestation of
the judges aroused a general outcry, which became furious when
Braxfield declared that he had no idea that his sentence of transportation
involved servitude and hard labour.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> The assertion implies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
an incredible ignorance in the man who had packed the juries
and sought to get his victims hanged. It may be regarded as a
cunning and cowardly attempt to shift part of the odium on
to the Government. Certainly the prestige of the Cabinet now
fell to zero. Ministers were held responsible for Braxfield's
wanton vagaries, and were accused of luring English democrats
into the meshes of the Scottish law. This last charge is absurd.
As we have seen, the London police sought to stop Margarot,
Sinclair, and Gerrald from going to Edinburgh. It was their
presence and that of the Irishmen which gave to the Convention
almost a national character, and placed it in rivalry to Parliament.
Their speeches were by far the most provocative. Finally,
as the letter quoted above shows, the initiative in arresting the
delegates was taken by Robert Dundas and the Scottish Solicitor-General.
On 11th December Henry Dundas wrote to his
nephew: "You get great credit here [London] for your attack
on the Convention."<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>Far different was the comment of the London Corresponding
Society. On 20th January 1794 that body convened a great
meeting which passed protests against the war, the expulsion of
the British Convention, and the arrest of delegates. It also resolved
that the general committee should sit permanently
throughout the ensuing session. Further, that if the Government
attacked the liberties of the people in the ways described
above, the committee should call "a General Convention of the
People for taking such measures under their consideration."<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
Equally threatening were the resolutions of the Constitutional
Society of London.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Pitt resolved to take up the gauntlet flung
down by these two powerful Societies. On 24th February 1794
Eaton, a publisher of Newgate Street, was tried for publishing
in his periodical pamphlet, "Politics for the People: or Hogs-wash,"
a little parable with which that witty lecturer, Thelwall,
had delighted a debating society. He told how a gamecock,
resplendent with ermine-spotted breast, and crown or cockscomb,
lorded it greedily over all the fowls of the farmyard.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
The parallel to George&nbsp;III was sufficiently close to agitate the
official mind; but the jury gave an open verdict, which implied
that the King was not hinted at.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>
<p>The next prosecution, that of Thomas Walker, of Manchester,
and six others broke down in a way highly discreditable
to the authorities. Walker's services to the cause of Reform
had, as we have seen, been conspicuous alike in energy and
moderation, and his enemies in the Church and King Club
made great exertions in order to procure a conviction. The
archives of the Home Office throw a sinister light on their
methods. A magistrate of Manchester, the Rev. John Griffith,
informed the Home Secretary that Booth, a man who was imprisoned
in June 1793 for seditious practices, made a declaration
against Thomas Walker and McCullum, members of the local
Constitutional Society. According to Booth, McCullum had
said: "Petitioning Parliament be d&mdash;&mdash;d. You may as well petition
the devil to reform himself. The only way is for each
Society to send a number of delegates to a certain place, and
there declare themselves the Representatives of the People and
support themselves as such." Thomas Walker had also said
that each member must have a musket, for they would soon
want them.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> But it transpired in the trial of Walker, McCullum,
and others that Griffith had let Booth see that he wanted to incriminate
Walker. He not only offered Booth his pardon for
such evidence, but left him alone with Dunn, a malicious perjurer,
the falsity of whose charges against Walker was convincingly
demonstrated.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> The case proves how far an unscrupulous
magistrate could succeed in getting charges trumped up against
an innocent man who opposed him in politics. Doubtless in
other cases personal spite, or the desire of a reward, led to the
offer of false charges; and the student who peruses the Home
Office archives needs to remember the Greek caution, <span class="greek" title="memn&ecirc;sth'
apistein" lang="el">&#956;&#8051;&#956;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#952;' &#7936;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>, as much as if he were perusing French Memoirs.</p>

<p>It is therefore with much doubt that one reads the declaration
of a Sheffield magistrate, in May 1794, that there was in that
town "a most horrid conspiracy against State and Church under
the pretence of Reform." A vast number of pikes and spears
had been made and "cats" to throw in the road to lame the
horses. 2nd July was fixed for the storming of the barracks and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>town. "It is a mercy the plot is discovered. I am to be all night
in the search." More detailed is the deposition of a magistrate of
Sheffield, James Wilkinson, that a democrat named Widdison
had made several pikes and sold twelve to Gales, a well-known
Jacobinical printer. Further, that a witness, William Green,
swore that a man named Jackson had employed him and others
to make spear-heads; they made twelve dozen or more in two
days, and the heads were sent to the lodgings of Hill and Jackson.
Wilkinson wrote for instructions how to deal with these
men; also for a warrant to arrest Gales. On 20th May Dundas
sent down warrants for the arrest of Gales, W. Carnage, H. Yorke
(<span lang="la">alias</span> Redhead), W. Broomhead, R. Moody, and T. Humphreys;
he also issued a warrant against Williams, a gun-engraver, of the
Tower, in London.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>In Birmingham, as we have seen, the two magistrates, Carles
and Spencer, were out and out loyalists; and, as they wrote to
Dundas on 23rd May 1794 that there was not enough evidence
to warrant a search for arms, we may infer that the Midland
capital caused the authorities less concern than rebellious Sheffield.
But even at Birmingham, with its traditions of exuberant
loyalty, there were grounds for concern. John Brook, the
mayor, informed Dundas that there were many malcontents in
the neighbourhood, especially at Dudley.</p>

<p>Turning to the East, we find signs that Norwich seethed with
discontent. From that city had come the first suggestion of a
General Convention of the People. On 5th March 1793 one of
the thirty Societies of Norwich wrote up to the London Corresponding
Society advocating that step, which Hardy and his
colleagues approved "so soon as the great body of the people
shall be courageous and virtuous enough to join us in the
attempt." I have found no proof that either at Norwich or in
London these Societies used illegal methods. The seditious
placards posted up at Norwich may have been the work of some
fanatic or of an <span lang="fr">agent provocateur</span>. But it is very doubtful
whether the holding of a People's Convention in the manner
proposed was not an act of defiance to Parliament, and therefore
seditious. Individual members certainly came within the ban of
the law. Thus, Dundas received tidings that two members of
Hardy's Society, named Stone and Meakins, were circulating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>seditious writings in Essex. When arrested they had with them
one or two military books, copies of the revolutionary song, <span lang="fr">&Ccedil;a
ira</span>, and similar papers;<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> but this fact does not incriminate the
Society at large. In fact, the reports as to the purchase of arms
and secret drillings are not very convincing. To take a few instances:
information was sent to the Home Office that a man
named Kitchen had sixty pikes in his house in George Street,
near York Buildings; also that men were drilled secretly at the
house of Spence, a seller of seditious pamphlets in the Little
Turnstile, Holborn, and at that of Shelmerdine, a small tradesman
of Southwark; the arms in the last case were bought from
Williams, of the Tower, with a sum of &pound;10 contributed by "a
desperate tailor of China Walk, Lambeth."<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Did patriotism or
private spite or greed of money incite these reports? Drawings
of pikes and spear-heads also diversified the report of the Secret
Committee of the Lords appointed to investigate seditious proceedings,
and probably convinced lovers of realism that plots
actually existed.</p>

<p>More alarming in reality were the preparations for a General
Convention of the People. The authorities knew that plans were
actually on foot for sending delegates to form such a body. On
27th March 1794 the London Corresponding Society consulted
the sister club on this question; and in due course delegates
from the two Societies passed resolutions in favour of the
scheme. Hardy thereupon sent a printed letter round to similar
bodies, probably early in the month of April 1794. It ran
thus:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>Notwithstanding the unparalleled audacity of a corrupt and overbearing
faction which at present tramples on the rights and liberties
of our people, our meetings cannot, in England, be interrupted without
the previous adoption of a Convention Bill<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>&mdash;a measure it is our duty
to anticipate.... Let us then form another British Convention. We
have a central situation in our view, which we believe would be most
convenient for the whole island, but which we forbear to mention&nbsp;...
till we have the answers of the Societies with which we are in correspondence.
Let us have your answer, then, by the 20th at farthest,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>earlier if possible, whether you approve of the measure and how many
delegates you can send, with the number also, if possible, of your
Societies.</p>

<p>PS. We have appointed a Secret Committee on this. Will you do
the same?<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>
</div>


<p>In order to further the scheme, the London Corresponding
Society held a meeting on 14th April at Chalk Farm, when an
ardent appeal was read from Hardy to resist the encroachments
on liberty recently made by "apostate reformers"&mdash;a fling at
Pitt. "Are they alone," he asked, "to judge of the fit time for
Reform?" The meeting then thanked Earl Stanhope for his
manly and successful opposition to the attempt to bring Hanoverian
and Hessian troops into England; it also condemned the
late rapid advances of despotism and the arming one part of the
people against the other. Finally it declared that in cases of
necessity the safety of the people was the only law. We may
here note that a few Hanoverian and Hessian battalions had
been landed in Hampshire, as a temporary measure, previous to
their transference to other ships. This occasioned some clamour
at Westminster, Grey, Fox, Sheridan and others claiming that
the liberties of England were in the direst danger. Pitt refused
to accept a Bill of Indemnity for his action, and the House supported
him by a great majority.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>The other reference at the Chalk Farm meeting was to the
proposal to sanction the subscriptions to the Volunteer forces
now being raised in various counties.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> At the outset this noble
movement had in view the defence of the constitution no less
than of the land; and this doubtless accounts for the fact that
Coke, Mingay, and other Norfolk Whigs struggled desperately
and successfully to break up a county meeting held at Norwich
for this purpose on 12th April, shouting down even so able
a speaker as Windham. In general, however, these meetings
were an immense success. That at Aylesbury realized &pound;5,851
for a county corps; and one at Epsom, for Surrey, brought in
nearly double as much.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Most noteworthy of all these meetings
was one of 19th April 1794 at Birmingham, where loyal sentiments
crystalized in a rhetorical jewel of rare lustre. The "Loyal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>True Blues" of Birmingham, in view of the threats of the French
"to insult the chalky cliffs of Albion and to plant in this island
their accursed tree of liberty, more baneful in its effects than
the poisonous tree of Java which desolates the country and corrupts
the winds of heaven," resolved to quit the field of argument
and to take arms as a Military Association. For nothing could
be so effective as "the decided and awful plan of the whole
Nation rising in a mass of Volunteers, determined to dispute
every inch of ground with their daring aggressors and to spill
the last drop of their blood in defence of their religion and their
laws." They beg Edward Carver to command them; they will
choose their uniform, will arrange themselves as grenadiers and
light infantry; and, "to preserve the <span lang="fr">coup d'&#0339;il</span>, the whole corps
will be arranged with the strictest attention to the height of the
members."<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Possibly the Royalists of Birmingham may have
known of the hint conveyed in Hardy's letter, that the National
Convention should assemble in some convenient centre, a phrase
which seemed to point to their town, which, indeed, the Chartists
chose for that purpose in 1839.</p>

<p>In view of the fervent loyalty manifested on all sides, Ministers
might surely have trusted to the majority to control the
restless minority. Auckland expressed the general opinion when
he said that the country in the proportion of ten to one was
sound and loyal.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> As the majority was armed, while the malcontents
had but small stores of pikes, there was little cause for
fear, though in the minority were some desperate men. In particular,
Richard Davison, a prominent member of the Sheffield
Constitutional Society, recommended the clubs of London and
Norwich to buy consignments of pikes in order to resist the
"newly-armed minions of the bare-faced aristocracy of the present
Administration"; and it afterwards appeared that he could
sell them at twenty pence each.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> This letter was sent off on
24th April, 1794, seventeen days after the holding of a mass
meeting on Castle Hill, Sheffield, at which the chairman, Henry
Yorke (<span lang="la">alias</span> Redhead), declared that, when the sun of Reason
shone in its fullest meridian, the people would turn out the 558
gentlemen from Westminster. The meeting resolved that, as the
people ought to demand universal suffrage as a right, and not
petition for it as a favour, they would never again petition the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>House of Commons on this subject.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> Contemptuous epithets
were now constantly hurled at Parliament. On 2nd May, that
genial toper, Horne Tooke, of Wimbledon, declared at a dinner
of the Constitutional Society in London that Parliament was a
scoundrel sink of corruption, and that the scoundrel Opposition
joined the scoundrel Government in order to destroy the rights
of Englishmen. In order to add weight to his epithets he called
the company to witness to his complete sobriety.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>Pitt and his colleagues now decided to strike at the leaders
who were planning a British Convention. Of these the most
formidable was the Secretary of the London Corresponding
Society. Accordingly, early on 12th May, some Bow Street
officers made their way into Hardy's shop, No. 9, Piccadilly,
arrested him, seized his papers, ransacking the room where Mrs.
Hardy was in bed. The shock to her nerves was such as to bring
on premature child-birth with fatal results. On the same day
a royal message came to Parliament announcing that the efforts
of certain Societies to summon a Convention in defiance of
Parliament had led him to order the seizure of their books and
papers. Those of the Corresponding and Constitutional Societies
were brought, sealed up, to the House of Commons on the morrow,
whereupon Pitt moved for the appointment of a secret
committee to examine them. He himself, Dundas, and nineteen
other members soon drew up the Report. When presented on
16th May, it contained a statement of all the threatening symptoms
of the time, and so far ignored the legal efforts of those
Societies as to form a very alarming diagnosis.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>The fears of Ministers were further aroused by the contents of
a letter from the Rev. Jeremiah Joyce (tutor of Earl Stanhope's
son) to Horne Tooke, which the Post Office had seized. It announced
the arrest of citizen Hardy, and ended thus: "Query:
is it possible to get ready by Thursday?"<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Some effort of the
imagination was needed to figure the Silenus of the literary
world as a plotter against the lives of Ministers. But they now
decided to arrest him and the Reverend Jeremiah, as well as
Bonney, Richter, and Kyd, also members of the Constitutional
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>Society, besides Camage and one or two other democrats of
Sheffield. Davison, the would-be seller of pikes, had fled betimes.</p>

<p>These were the circumstances which induced Pitt to propose
the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act (16th May). The
Report of the Secret Committee having been read, he proceeded
to exaggerate the import of the more threatening parts of the
evidence, and to convince the House that these Societies, which
had congratulated the French Convention, and still aped its
methods, were plotting to set up an authority openly hostile to
Parliament. With all the force of his oratory he pictured the
state of things that must ensue&mdash;"an enormous torrent of insurrection,
which would sweep away all the barriers of government,
law and religion, and leave our country a naked waste for
usurped authority to range in, uncontrolled and unresisted."
Despite the warning of Fox that the remedy now proposed was
worse than the evil which it sought to avert; despite the pleas
of Grey and Sheridan against indecent haste in hurrying on
this arbitrary measure, it was forced through every stage in the
Commons at that single sitting; finally, at half-past three in the
morning, the numbers of the Whig protestors sank to 13, while
the Ministerialists still mustered 108 strong.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>This collapse of the Opposition was due to a sharp cleavage
in its ranks on the vital issues now at stake. As has already
appeared, Pitt had consulted the Duke of Portland and his immediate
followers on subjects affecting public order. Some of the Old
Whigs, notably Windham, served on the Committee of Secrecy;
and the evidence there forthcoming led them to propose a
general support of Government both in its war policy and the
maintenance of order. Those eager Royalists, Burke and Windham,
took the lead in proposing an alliance with the Ministry.
The question arose whether the Old Whigs should support from
outside or actually coalesce with the Ministry, taking their fair
share of power. Burke strongly advised the latter course as the
only means of assuring continued and strenuous support. This
opened a sluice gate of correspondence, resulting in important
changes in the Cabinet. I shall refer to this matter later, merely
noting here that the Duke of Portland took over from Dundas
the Home Office, which was thenceforth limited to British and
Irish affairs, Dundas becoming Secretary of State for War, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>Windham Secretary at War. The changes were most opportune;
for they strengthened the administrative machine and served to
build up a national party strong enough to cope with the growing
difficulties of the time. Thenceforth there was no danger of the
overthrow of the Ministry. Further, the panic pervading all
parts of England in May 1794 was soon allayed by the news of
Howe's victory, termed "the glorious First of June"; while in
July the fall of Robespierre caused a general sense of relief. In
view of these events, Pitt would have done well to relax his
efforts against the British Jacobins. He held on his way and
encountered sharp rebuffs. The trial of Hardy and others in
October dragged on to a great length; and, after hearing an
enormous mass of evidence (some of which proved the possession
of arms by democrats) the jury returned a verdict of Not
Guilty. This result, due to the masterly defence by Erskine
and Gibbs, aroused a tumult of joy in the vast crowd outside
such as London had rarely seen. Hardy afterwards asserted
that, in case of a conviction, Government had decided
to arrest about 800 more persons.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> This is mere hearsay; but
it has been fastened upon by those who seek to father upon
Pitt the design of reviving the days of Strafford and "Thorough."
A fortnight previously Watt, once a government informer, was
convicted at Edinburgh of a treasonable plot to set the city on
fire, sack the banks, and attack the castle. Before he went to
execution he confessed his guilt.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>This was the only conviction obtained by Government. The
trial of Horne Tooke ran a course unfavourable to Ministers,
the evidence for the prosecution being flimsy in the extreme.
Pitt himself was called to the witness-box, and when closely
cross-questioned by Erskine as to his former connection with
the Reform cause, admitted that he was present at a meeting at
the Duke of Richmond's residence, at which delegates from
county Reform Associations were present. The admission
exposed him to the charge of inconsistency in the eyes of those
who looked only at the surface of things. In reality, those who
met at the Duke of Richmond's house had nothing in common
with the democratic clubs which proposed to override the will
of Parliament by a National Convention. Yet, as the superficial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>view gains a ready assent, the fame of Pitt now underwent an
eclipse. Never again did he hear the whole-hearted acclaim
which greeted him in the years 1784&ndash;90. The roar of delight
which went up at the news of the acquittal of Horne Tooke was
a sign of the advent of a new era, in whose aspirations Pitt had
no part.</p>

<p>The prosecutions against Bonney, Joyce, Kyd, and Holcroft
were now dropped. The charge against Thelwall was pressed
home, but resulted in another defeat for Government. Thus,
except in the case of Watt, no proof was forthcoming of treasonable
designs, though the apprehension of Davison of Sheffield
might perhaps have led to discoveries of that nature. In the
main, then, Pitt and his colleagues failed to justify the harsh
measure of suspending the Habeas Corpus Act; and the failure
of the State prosecutions led to a marked increase of the membership
and activity of the London Corresponding Society, with
results which will appear later.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Pitt's conduct is far from indefensible with regard
to the main point at issue, the meeting of a National Convention.
In view of the projects of some of the wilder spirits at London,
Sheffield, Norwich, and Edinburgh, it is presumptuous to charge
him with causelessly seeking to bring about a "Reign of
Terror." He was face to face with developments which might
easily have become dangerous; and, with the example of Paris
before him, he not unnaturally took what he thought to be
the safer course, that of stopping them at the outset. Indeed,
we may question whether Fox, had he been in power, would
have allowed the assembling of a National Convention, pledged
to press upon Parliament measures which he reprobated.</p>

<p>It is when we come to details that Pitt is open to the charge
of acting with undue severity. Considering the proved loyalty
of the great mass of the people, what need was there to
inaugurate a system of arbitrary arrests? After all, England
was not France. Here no systematic assault had been made on
the institutions in Church and State. The constitution had
suffered dilapidation, but it was storm-proof, and the garrison
was strongly entrenched. Moreover, the democrats for the most
part urged their case without any of the appeals to violence
which wrought havoc in France. There the mob delighted to
hurry a suspect to <span lang="fr">la lanterne</span> and to parade heads on pikes. Here
the mass meeting at Chalk Farm, or on Castle Hill, Sheffield,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
ended with loss neither of life nor of property. So far as I have
found, not one life was taken by the people in the course of this
agitation&mdash;a fact which speaks volumes for their religious
sense, their self-restraint even amidst deep poverty, and, in
general, their obedience to law even when they deemed it
oppressive. The hero of the year 1794 is not William Pitt, but
the British nation.</p>

</div>


<p>As in parliamentary life, so too in the wider spheres of
diplomacy and warfare, a Coalition very rarely holds
together under a succession of sharp blows. This is inherent in
the nature of things. A complex or heterogeneous substance is
easily split up by strokes which leave a homogeneous body
intact. Rocks of volcanic origin defy the hammer under which
conglomerates crumble away; and when these last are hurled
against granite or flint, they splinter at once. Well might
Shakespeare speak through the mouth of Ulysses these wise
words on the divisions of the Greeks before Troy:</p>


<p class="poem">
<span class="i2">Look how many Grecian tents do stand<br /></span>
Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.<br />
<span class="spaced">...</span><br />
Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
</p>


<p>Pitt and his colleagues were under no illusion as to the weakness
of the first Coalition against France. They well knew the
incurable jealousies of the Houses of Hapsburg and Hohenzollern,
the utter weakness of the Holy Roman Empire, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>poverty or torpor of Spain, Sardinia, and Naples, the potent
distractions produced by the recent partition of Poland, and the
Machiavellian scheme of the Empress Catharine&nbsp;II to busy the
Central Powers in French affairs so that she might have a free
hand at Warsaw. All this and much more stood revealed to
them. But they grounded their hopes of success on two important
considerations; first, that the finances of France were
exhausted; secondly, that the rule of the Jacobins, fertile in
forced loans, forced service, and guillotining, must speedily
collapse. On the subject of French finance there are many
notes in the Pitt Papers, which show that Pitt believed an utter
breakdown to be imminent. Grenville, too, at the close of
October 1793, stated that France had lost at least 200,000
soldiers, while more than 50,000 were in hospital. The repugnance
to military service was universal, and the deficit for the
month of August alone was close on &pound;17,000,000.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>Above all, Pitt and Grenville believed the French Government
to be incompetent as well as exasperatingly cruel. In their
eyes Jacobins were sworn foes to all that made government
possible. The mistake was natural. The English Ministers knew
little of what was going on in France, and therefore failed to
understand that the desperadoes now in power at Paris were
wielding a centralized despotism, compared with which that of
Louis&nbsp;XIV was child's play. As to the Ph&#0339;nix-like survival
of French credit, it is inexplicable even to those who have
witnessed the wonders wrought by Thiers in 1870&ndash;3. All that
can be said is that the Jacobins killed the goose that laid the
golden egg, and yet the golden eggs were laid. Let him who
understands the miracle of revolutionary finance cast the first
stone at Pitt.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister also erred when he believed the French
social structure to be breaking up. Here again the miscalculation
was perfectly natural in an age which regarded kings,
nobles, and bishops as the fixed stars of a universe otherwise
diversified only by a dim Milky Way. The French were the
first to dispel these notions. In truth the strength of the young
giant bore witness to the potency of the new and as yet allied
forces&mdash;Democracy and Nationality. In 1792 Democracy girded
itself eagerly against the semi-feudal Powers, Austria and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>Prussia; but the strength latent in the French people appeared
only in the next year when, on the accession of England, Spain,
and the Empire to the Coalition, plans were discussed of detaching
Alsace, Lorraine, Roussillon, and Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> To these sacrilegious
schemes the French patriots opposed the dogma of Rousseau&mdash;the
indivisibility of the general will. "Perish 25,000,000
Frenchmen rather than the Republic one and indivisible." This
perfervid, if illogical, exclamation of a Commissioner of the
Convention reveals something of that passion for unity which
now fused together the French nation. Some peoples merge
themselves slowly together under the shelter of kindred beliefs
and institutions. Others again, after feeling their way towards
closer union, finally achieve it in the explosion of war or revolution.
The former case was the happy lot of the British nation;
the latter, that of the French. Pitt, with his essentially English
outlook, failed to perceive that the diverse peoples grouped
together under the French monarchy had now attained to an
indissoluble unity under the stress of the very blows which he
and his Allies dealt in Flanders, Alsace, and Provence.</p>

<p>For by this time the counter-strokes dealt by the Republicans
were telling with fatal effect on their adversaries. The failure of
the Spanish campaign in Roussillon and the irruption of a French
force into Catalonia dashed the spirits of that weak and wavering
monarch, Charles&nbsp;IV; and already whispers were heard that
peace with France was necessary. The disputes with England
concerning Nootka Sound and affairs at Toulon predisposed the
King and his people to think with less horror of the regicides of
Paris. As for Sardinia, the childish obscurantism of the Court
of Turin had nursed to quick life a mushroom growth of Jacobinism.
The army defending the Alpine passes was honeycombed
with discontent; and the suspicious conduct of Austria towards
her little ally foreshadowed the divisions and disasters which
quickly followed on the advent of Bonaparte at that theatre of
the war.</p>

<p>It was clear that only from London could come the impulse
which would invigorate this anaemic Coalition. Pitt sought to
impart such an impulse in the King's Speech at the opening of
the Session of 1794. It had throughout a defiant ring. The
capture of three of the northern fortresses of France, the gains
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>in the East and West Indies (they amounted to Pondicherry,
Chandernagore, and Tobago, together with Miquelon and St.
Pierre), the blow dealt to her navy at Toulon, and the impossibility
of her continuing the recent prodigious exertions, were in
turn duly emphasized. And on 21st January 1794, when Fox
moved an amendment in favour of peace, the Prime Minister
spoke even more strongly of the madness of coming to terms
with the present rulers of France. Could any statesman not
gifted with second sight have spoken otherwise? At that time
the Reign of Terror was approaching its climax. The Goddess
of Reason had lately been enthroned in Notre Dame amidst
ribald songs and dances. The schism between Robespierre and
the atheistical party was beginning to appear; and few persons
believed that France would long bend the knee before the lords
of the guillotine, whose resources were largely derived from the
plunder of churches and banks, forced loans from the wealthy,
and a graduated Income Tax resembling the Spartan proposals
of Thomas Paine.</p>

<p>In such a case Pitt naturally repeated his statement of the
previous session, that he altogether deprecated a peace with
France, unless it possessed some elements of permanence, and
secured due indemnity to Great Britain. Nay, he declared that
he would rather persevere with war, even in the midst of disasters,
than come to terms with the present rulers of France, who
were alike enemies of order and rabid foes of England. They
drove men into battle by fear of the guillotine; they formed
rapine and destruction into a system, and perverted to their
detestable purposes all the talents and ingenuity derived from
the civilization around them. He was careful, however, to correct
the mis-statement of Fox, that the Government was struggling
for the restoration of the French monarchy. While believing
that that nation would live most happily under a King, Pitt
denied that a restoration was the object of the present war. We
have already seen that he held this view in his correspondence
with the Austrian Court. The House supported Ministers by
277 votes to 59.</p>

<p>These declarations, backed by so large a majority, caused
great satisfaction at Vienna, and heartened that Government in
the midst of its many uncertainties. There was every need of
encouragement. In that age, when the great monarchs of the
eighteenth century had passed, or were passing, away, Francis&nbsp;II<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
stood somewhat low among the mediocrities on whom fell the
strokes of destiny. He was a poor replica of Leopold&nbsp;II. Where
the father was supple and adroit, the son was perversely obstinate
or weakly pliable. In place of foresight and tenacity in the
pursuit of essentials, Francis was remarkable for a more than
Hapsburg narrowness of view, and he lacked the toughness
which had not seldom repaired the blunders of that House.
Those counsellors swayed him most who appealed to his family
pride, or satisfied his other dominant feelings, attachment to
the old order of things and a pedantic clinging to established
usages. But the weakness of his character soon became so
patent as to excite general distrust, especially as he was
swayed by the wayward impulses of his consort, a daughter of
Ferdinand&nbsp;IV and Maria Carolina of Naples. From her mother
she inherited a hatred of French principles and the bent towards
intrigue and extravagance which wrecked the careers of that
Queen and of her sister, Marie Antoinette. Francis&nbsp;II and his
consort longed to stamp out the French plague; but they lacked
the strength of mind and of will that commands success. Our
special envoy at Vienna, Thomas Grenville, questioned whether
the Emperor "had steadiness enough to influence the Government."</p>

<p>According to the same competent judge, the Chancellor Thugut
was the only efficient Minister, being very laborious in his
work, and indeed "the only man of business about the Court."<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
Yet Thugut was rather a clever diplomat and ideal head-clerk
than a statesman. In forethought he did not much excel his
master. Indeed, his personality and his position alike condemned
him to aim at cheap and easy gains. His features and figure
were mean. Worse still, he was of low birth, a crime in the eyes
of nobles and courtiers who for nearly half a century had seen
the prestige of the Chancery enhanced by the lordly airs and
whims of Kaunitz. Fear of courtly intrigues ever obsessed the
mind of Thugut; and thus, whenever the horizon darkened,
this coast-hugging pilot at once made for the nearest haven. In
particular, as the recovery of Belgium in the year 1793 brought
no financial gain, but unending vistas of war, he sought other
means of indemnity, and discovered them in Alsace-Lorraine,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>South Poland, and Venice. The first was a concession to the
pride of the House of Hapsburg-Lorraine; but Thugut saw in
Venetia and in the land south of Warsaw the readiest means of
indemnifying Austria for the loss of her Belgic Provinces, which
after the defeat of Wattignies (October 1793) he probably expected
and welcomed.</p>

<p>In this orientation of Hapsburg policy Thugut did but follow
the impulse first imparted by Hertzberg at Berlin. As we have
seen, Frederick William&nbsp;II entered on the French war in one of
his chivalrous moods, which passed away amidst the smoke of
Valmy. The miseries of the retreat Rhinewards, and the incursion
of the French into the valley of the Main taught him prudence,
while the ease of his conquest of Great Poland early in
the year 1793 assured the victory of statecraft over chivalry.
Morton Eden reported from Berlin that, had the preparations
for the Valmy campaign equalled in thoroughness those for the
invasion of Poland, events must have gone very differently in
Champagne. The circumspection with which the Prussians conducted
the siege of Mainz in the summer of 1793, and the long
delays of the autumn, have already been noticed. The result of
it was that at Christmastide of the year 1793 Pichegru and
Hoche threw back Wurmser in disastrous rout, and compelled
Brunswick hurriedly to retire to the Rhine.</p>

<p>As always happens between discordant allies after defeats,
Berlin and Vienna indulged in a war of words, amidst which the
Coalition would probably have broken up but for the efforts of
British diplomacy. The Pitt Ministry had despatched to Berlin
the ablest of British diplomatists, Lord Malmesbury, with a view
to strengthening the accord between the three Powers; and the
mingled charm and authority of his presence did much to
thwart the petty prejudices and intrigues prevalent at that
capital. He took Brussels and Frankfurt on his way to Berlin,
and his diary shows the listlessness or discontent which had
infected the officers of the British army. Many of them openly
brought against the Duke of York the most outrageous and
unfounded charges, and it seems that about fifty of them went
on furlough to England, where they spread those slanders and
played into the hands of the Opposition.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Malmesbury's converse
with the Duke and others at Ath convinced him that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>commander-in-chief was striving manfully and generously
against a situation full of difficulty.</p>

<p>At Frankfurt, and again at Berlin, Malmesbury found signs
that Frederick William was ashamed at the ignominious issue
of the campaign, and professed a desire to take up the duties
which the Duke of Brunswick had so haltingly fulfilled. The
King seemed rather pleased than otherwise at the Austrian
reverses in the north of Alsace, but by no means indisposed to
renew the attack upon France, always provided that England
paid him a sufficient subsidy. He assured the envoy that his
<span lang="fr">chef-d'&#0339;uvre</span>, the Triple Alliance of 1788, was still a reality, but
he declared, on the faith of an honest man, that the state of
Prussia's finances would not enable him to face a third campaign.
In point of fact, out of the reserve fund of 80,000,000
crowns which Frederick the Great had handed on, only 20,000,000
or perhaps only 14,000,000 remained in the early days of 1794.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>Other difficulties beset the Prussian monarch. Want of work
had driven the weavers of Silesia to a state of frenzy and
tumult almost resembling a <span lang="fr">Jacquerie</span>; and there and elsewhere
serfs and peasants talked openly of casting off the restraints and
burdens of Feudalism. In such a case the veriest autocrat must
pause before he commits his country to the risks of a loan (that
of 1792 had exhausted Prussia's credit), or to a campaign where
the losses were certain and the gains doubtful. On this last
topic various schemes had been bandied to and fro between
Berlin and Vienna. The debt of honour certainly bade Frederick
William help to secure to his rival a counterpart to Prussia's
acquisitions in Poland; but, apart from this consideration and
the need of stamping out the French pest in the Rhineland, the
politicians of Berlin found few reasons for prolonging the war.
What wonder, then, that they set on foot intrigues with the
regicides of Paris? Marshal M&ouml;llendorf, the commander whom
Frederick William substituted for the weary and disgusted Duke
of Brunswick, proved to be a partisan of peace.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>Royalist at heart, but beset by advisers and mistresses who
fanned his jealousy of Austria and love of ease, Frederick
William wavered under the whims of the hour or the counsels
of the last comer. Malmesbury thus summed up the question
now at issue in his letter to Pitt of 9th January 1794: "Can we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>do without the King of Prussia or can we not? If we can, he is
not worth the giving of a guinea for. If we cannot, I am afraid
we cannot give too many." Malmesbury saw no means of keeping
Frederick William steady up to the end of the war. Pitt and
Grenville, however, devised the following expedient. They offered
the sum of &pound;2,000,000 for bringing 100,000 Prussians into the field.
Of this sum Great Britain would furnish two fifths (or &pound;800,000),
and Austria and Holland each one fifth, the last fifth being
advanced by Prussia herself until she reimbursed herself from
France at the general peace. The device was suggestive of that
of the rustic who tempts his beast of burden onwards by dangling
a choice vegetable before his nose.</p>

<p>Frederick William alone might have been attracted by the
offer; but his advisers haggled long and obstinately over details.
Chief among the objectors was a Councillor of State, Haugwitz,
an oily, plausible creature, whose Gallophil leanings were
destined finally to place his country under the heel of Napoleon
and deal a death-blow to Pitt. For the present, he treated
Malmesbury with a moderation and courtesy that deftly veiled
a determined opposition. The British envoy was fully his match.
Finding that Haugwitz ascribed all difficulties and delays to the
Austrian embassy, he advised him to propose the transfer of the
negotiations to The Hague, where these annoyances would cease.
Vain and always prone to take the easiest course, Haugwitz
swallowed the bait and succeeded in carrying a point which was
all in Malmesbury's favour, especially as it saved time in communicating
with Downing Street. After annoying delays they set
out on 23rd March; and with the aid of twenty-two horses at
each post traversed the 326 (English) miles to The Hague in 120
hours during the days, 23rd&ndash;30th March, when the campaign
ought to have opened.</p>

<p>The prospects at Vienna were equally gloomy. Morton Eden's
reports to Grenville form an unrelieved jeremiad. Even amidst
the alarms caused by the disasters at Toulon and in the
Palatinate, jealousy of Prussia was the dominant feeling. The
utmost efforts of our ambassador failed to convince Francis&nbsp;II
and Thugut of the need of humouring Prussia by meeting her
demand for an additional subsidy and by guaranteeing bread
and forage for the 20,000 men who formed her contingent in the
Austrian service. Into these wearisome quarrels we need not
enter, further than to note that they were envenomed by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
acerbity of the Prussian ambassador at Vienna. The Marquis
Lucchesini, born at Lucca in 1752, early entered the service of
Frederick the Great, to whom he acted as reader. He advanced
rapidly under his successor. His commanding demeanour and
vivacity of speech, added to great powers of work, and acuteness
in detecting the foibles of others, made him a formidable opponent.
Further, his marriage with the sister of Bischoffswerder,
until lately the King's favourite adviser, added to his influence,
which, as was natural with a foreigner, inclined towards the
attractive and gainful course. Long afterwards the saviour of
Prussia, Baron vom Stein, classed him among the narrow,
selfish, insincere men who had been the ruin of nations.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Certainly
he helped to ruin Poland; and now his conduct at Vienna
clogged the efforts of Morton Eden and Malmesbury to strengthen
the Coalition against France. Eden complained that he behaved
as an intriguing subaltern rather than as an ambassador; and
rumour credibly ascribed his tortuous and exasperating conduct
to French gold.</p>

<p>In the midst of his irritation against Prussia and her envoy,
Thugut heard with astonishment the British proposals, presented
at Berlin early in February, to bring 100,000 Prussians into the
field. Urgently he remonstrated with Eden, pointing out that
Prussia had played them false in two campaigns, and would do
so again, witness her late contention that France must not be
weakened. On no account, then, must Frederick William head a
compact mass of 100,000 men in the Palatinate. He would be
the arbiter of the situation. He would be between the Austrian
army in Brabant and the Hapsburg States. Nay, he might
march into Swabia, reach the Danube, take boats at Ulm, and,
sailing down that stream, have Vienna at his mercy!<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> So pressing
were these anxieties that, at the close of February, Thugut
sent a special request to Catharine&nbsp;II to guarantee the security
of Austria's possessions in case Frederick William withdrew
from the Coalition.</p>

<p>Despite the utmost efforts of the British Ministry and its envoys,
no plan of vigorous co-operation could be arranged between the
two German rivals; the sole link connecting them was the
clause of the treaty of 1792, whereby Austria, as having been
attacked by France, claimed the help of 20,000 Prussians.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>Frederick William decided that this force must remain at Mainz,
in order to guard the Empire from a French raid. He promised
80,000 more troops to Great Britain and Holland, provided that
they were paid for. On one point alone the four Allies came
near to agreement, namely, that the main Prussian army should
operate in Flanders, so as effectively to defend the Dutch territory,
secure conquests in the North of France, and, above all,
preclude the quarrels which must ensue if it acted near the
Austrians.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Thugut of course assented, his great aim being to
remove the Prussians as far as possible from Swabia. Disputes
on these subjects went on up to the end of March 1794, the time
when an advance into French Flanders promised great results.</p>

<p>The reader will naturally ask&mdash;Can this be called a Coalition?
A Coalition implies some power of coalescing. But among the
four Powers there was far more of disunion than union. In
fact, England was the sole link between these wrangling confederates,
and that, too, solely by means of what Carlyle called
the cash nexus. Grenville, using a more homely metaphor,
averred that the German princes turned towards England as an
inexhaustible milch-cow. The animal in this case could dictate
her terms; and thus the relations of the three Powers resembled
those of a rich but somewhat exigent employer to grumbling and
distrustful employees. Holland also, in return for her sacrifices
in men and money, demanded from Austria a better frontier on
the side of Dutch Flanders and Maestricht, to which the Viennese
Court opposed a quiet but firm resistance.</p>

<p>It speaks volumes for the confidence inspired by Pitt and
Grenville, and for the tactful zeal of Malmesbury and Eden, that
they induced the German rivals to make one more effort. The
Duke of York also played an important part in the formation of
the plan of campaign; for he it was who persuaded Colonel
Mack to accompany him to London, and there discuss with
Ministers the alternative schemes. The mention of Mack will
excite surprise among those who know of him only by the futile
Neapolitan campaign of 1799, and the frightful disaster of Ulm.
In regard to strategy and the theory of war he displayed much
ability; and his administrative talents and energy as Quarter-Master-General
in 1793 should have screened him from the
criticism that he discoursed brilliantly on war in <span lang="fr">salons</span>, and in
the council rhetorically developed specious and elegant plans.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>
<p>Mack's plan of operations was first submitted to the judgement
of the Archduke Charles, the Prince of Coburg, Count Mercy, the
Prince of Orange, and the Duke of York, at Brussels. Next, he
proceeded, along with Counts Stahremberg and Merveldt to
London, and on 13th February unfolded his plan to Pitt,
Grenville, and Dundas. The Duke of York had preceded him
by two days, but was absent from this conference. It became
piquant when Pitt "playfully" remarked to Mack that a great
general had recently arrived at London whose appointment to
the command of the British force in Flanders would doubtless
meet with his warm approval. After a little more fencing, Pitt
gave the name of the Marquis Cornwallis, who had just returned
from his Viceroyalty in India. Mack by no means welcomed
the proposal, and made the irreverent remark that the best
General, after fighting elephants in India, would be puzzled by
the French. Pitt thereupon observed that the Duke of York
had not the confidence of the army, to which Mack and
Merveldt replied by praising his character, and decrying his
critics as a set of influential but inexperienced youths.</p>

<p>The matter then dropped, and the Duke was present at the
conference on the morrow. Finally, Austria and England bound
themselves to make great efforts, the latter with at least 40,000
men, either British or German auxiliaries. The Prussian and
Dutch forces were to be increased so as to bring the grand total
to 340,000 men. Of this large number 170,000 were to operate
in Flanders with a view to a march on Paris; 35,000 held the
country along the right bank of the Meuse; 15,000 protected
Luxemburg; 65,000 Prussians prolonged the line eastwards to
the Rhine, which was guarded by 55,000 Austrians. Certainly
the plan called for a third of a million of men, if all the frontier
strongholds of Flanders were to be taken before the march to
Paris began. In regard to details, Pitt, Grenville, and Dundas
urged that Cornwallis should command the British and subsidiary
forces defending West Flanders&mdash;a suggestion which
George&nbsp;III warmly approved, on condition that the Duke of
York, serving with the main body nearer the centre of the
long line, had a number of troops proportionate to his rank
and talents.</p>

<p>Thus the effort of Pitt and his colleagues to shelve the Duke
of York was foiled. On another and weightier matter he had
his way. Coburg's conduct had been so languid and unenterprising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
as to lead to urgent demands for his recall; and it was
understood that the Emperor Francis would take the command,
with Mack as Chief-of-Staff and virtual director of the campaign.
Pitt expressed to Mack his marked preference of this arrangement
to the alternative scheme, the appointment of the Archduke
Charles; for the extreme youth of the Archduke might hinder
a good understanding between him and his subordinate and
senior, the Duke of York. Seeing, then, that Mack declined
absolutely to serve under Coburg,<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> nothing but the presence of
the Emperor could end the friction in Flanders.</p>

<p>But alas for the monarchical cause! At the very time when
the Kaiser was to set out for Brussels, alarming news came from
Cracow. The temper of the Poles, heated by the wrongs and
insults of two years, burst forth in a rising against the Russian
and Prussian authorities. Kosciusko, the last hope of Poland,
issued an appeal which nerved his countrymen to dare the
impossible. Rushing to arms, they astonished the world by
exhibiting in the last throes of their long agony a strength which,
if put forth in 1791, might have saved their land from spoliation.
Even now their despairing struggles turned towards Warsaw
much of the energy which should have trended towards Paris;
and thus, once again, and not for the last time, did the foul
crimes of 1772 and 1793 avenge themselves on their perpetrators.
The last struggles of Poland helped on the French Republic
to its mighty adolescence. Finally, on 2nd April, Francis&nbsp;II
departed for Brussels. Thugut set out nine days later; and in
the interval, on the plausible pretext that Prussia would seize
more Polish land, he stopped the reinforcements destined for
Flanders. He also urged the Czarina on no account to allow a
partition of Poland.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>While the Continental States were thus pulling different ways,
British diplomacy won two notable triumphs at The Hague.
By dint of threatening Haugwitz with the rupture of the whole
negotiation, Malmesbury induced that Minister to countermand
the order for the retirement of the Prussian troops, which
had already begun. He thereby saved the Allies in the
Palatinate and Flanders from very serious risks in view of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>gathering masses of the French.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Further, on 19th April, he
induced Haugwitz to sign a treaty which promised to revivify
the monarchical cause. Prussia agreed to furnish, by 24th May,
62,400 men, who were to act conjointly with the British and
Dutch forces in Flanders. For this powerful succour the two
Maritime States would pay a subsidy of &pound;50,000 a month,
besides the cost of bread and forage, reckoned at &pound;1 12<i>s.</i> per
man per month, and &pound;300,000 for initial expenses. As Great
Britain and Holland wholly supported this army, they prescribed
the sphere of its operations, and retained any conquests that it
might make. The treaty was for the year 1794; but its renewal
was stipulated in a separate article. Prussia of course still supplied
to Austria the 20,000 men due by the treaty of 1792.</p>

<p>If Malmesbury had not induced Haugwitz to sign the treaty
then, it would never have been signed at all. Almost alone in
the Court of Berlin, Frederick William desired to continue the
struggle. His uncle, Prince Henry, had always opposed war with
France, and long before Valmy, had prophesied that her untrained
but enthusiastic levies would be a match for any professional
army. His influence and that of the Duke of Brunswick,
Lucchesini, and M&ouml;llendorf, were still cast against the western
crusade, so that Grenville believed Prussia to be dragging on the
negotiation solely in order to embarrass her Allies by throwing
it up early in the campaign.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Moreover, Malmesbury's treaty
contained its own death warrant. A Great Power can ill afford
to hire out its troops to non-military States, unless they lessen
the humiliation of such a proceeding by according the utmost
possible freedom. But the Hague Convention specified that the
subsidized Prussian army must operate where the paymasters
directed; and they now decided on removing it from the
Palatinate to the valley of the Meuse near Dinant, or even
further west, provided that Austria could fill up the gap thus
left in the Palatinate.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> In passing, I may note that this important
decision was due to George&nbsp;III, as appears in Grenville's final
instruction to Malmesbury: "The King's determination is finally
taken not to agree to any plan by which the Prussians would be
employed more to the left than the country of the Meuse."<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> No
one who knows the rigour of the King's resolves can doubt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>that he was responsible for a determination fraught with unexpected
issues.</p>

<p>It is alien to my purpose to recount the ensuing disputes. I
can glance only at the part played by Pitt. At one point his
conduct was weak and dilatory. Early in May, when Malmesbury
proceeded to London for the purpose of securing the ratification
of the treaty and the payment of the first subsidy to Prussia,
he encountered most annoying delays. Pitt and Grenville left
him severely alone, probably because they were then so occupied
with the coercion of the English Jacobins as to have no time for
the plans which promised the overthrow of the French Jacobins.
Another topic engaging their attention was the hoped-for coalition
with the Portland Whigs, which shrouded from their gaze
the needs of the European Coalition. However we may explain
the fact, it is certain that during sixteen days (6th to 22nd May)
Malmesbury, despite his urgent entreaties to Grenville, could
procure neither instructions as to his future conduct, nor a
promise for the payment of the first Prussian subsidy. News of
a British disaster in Flanders at last quickened the laggards of
Whitehall. On the 23rd Malmesbury gained his heart's desire,
and set out for the Prussian headquarters on the following day.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
Meanwhile, owing to this long delay (one of the most discreditable
incidents in the careers of Pitt and Grenville), Prussia took
no steps to carry out the terms of the compact. It so happened
that on 24th May her army in the Palatinate, commanded by
<span class="ins" title="M&ouml;llendorff">M&ouml;llendorf</span>, gained a victory over the French at Kaiserslautern
in the Palatinate; but that event set them the more against
Malmesbury's treaty, which implied a march of some 120 miles
through difficult country, and across an enemy's front.</p>

<p>Moreover, as has been hinted, reverses had by this time overtaken
the right wing of the Allies, in West Flanders. At the
centre, near the Sambre, the campaign opened with promise, the
British cavalry gaining a brilliant success at Bethencourt. But
Carnot, having drawn upon the French troops in Lorraine and
the Palatinate, threw his heaviest columns at points on the
extreme west of the French front, the result being that at Turcoing
the Republicans shattered the isolated corps of the Duke of
York and General Otto (18th May). The successes of the Prussians
and of the Austrian army, on the Sambre, saved the situation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
for a time. But the prospects even in that quarter were
overclouded by the resolve of the Emperor Francis to leave his
army and return to Vienna. News of the critical state of affairs
in Poland prompted this decision, the results of which soon
appeared in quarrels at headquarters and discouragement in the
rank and file. The Austrian soldiery saw in the withdrawal of
the Kaiser the end of his rule in the Netherlands. They were
right. The counsels of Thugut had now prevailed. South Poland
was to be the prize of the Hapsburgs. The tiresome and distant
Netherlands were to be given up, the pecuniary support of
England, however, being assured as far as possible by a feint of
defending them.</p>

<p>Here we have the explanation of the half-hearted effort made
by the Austrians at Fleurus. There was every reason why
Coburg, now again the commander of the main Austrian force,
should strike vigorously at the French force besieging Charleroi.
A decisive victory in front of Charleroi would not only save that
place, but would give pause to the French forces further west,
now advancing rapidly towards Ghent. Accordingly Coburg,
advancing as far as Fleurus, hard by the village of Ligny, attacked
the Republicans. He had on the whole the best of the fight,
when the arrival of news of the surrender of Charleroi led him
most tamely to call off his men and fall back. The retirement
took place in discreditably good order, not a single gun being
lost (25th June 1794). A bold leader would have beaten the
enemy and probably would have saved Charleroi. With the same
excess of prudence Coburg conducted his retreat, several positions
and strongholds being abandoned in craven fashion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pitt and Dundas made great efforts to save West
Flanders. In haste they despatched reinforcements to Ostend;
and among the regiments which landed there on 25th and 26th
June was the 33rd, commanded by Colonel Wellesley. The
future Duke of Wellington found the small garrison of Ostend
in a state of panic; and his chief, the Earl of Moira, deemed it
best to meet the French in the open. By great good fortune
Moira, with most of the regiments, reached Bruges, and beyond
that town came into touch with Clerfait's force. Wellesley,
taking ship, sailed round to Antwerp and reached that column
by a safer route and earlier than his chief. His action is characteristic
of a judgement that never erred, a will that never faltered.
In this campaign, as he afterwards said, he learnt how not to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
make war. But success not seldom crowns the efforts of him
who has the good sense to probe the causes of failure. Certainly
it rarely comes to British commanders save after very chastening
experiences; and Wellesley now took part in what was, for
the Austrians, a fore-ordained retreat. Despite the manly appeals
of the Duke of York, Coburg declined to make a stand on the
fateful ridge of Mount St. Jean; and the name of Waterloo
appears in the tepid records of 1794 at the head of a plan for
arranging the stages of the retreat (5th July) which the nervousness
of Coburg soon condemned to the limbo of unfulfilled
promises.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Is it surprising that, two days later, the Duke of York
declared to him that the British were "betrayed and sold to the
enemy"? Worse still, the garrisons of Valenciennes, Cond&eacute;,
Quesnoy, and Landrecies, amounting to nearly 11,000 men, were
now left to their fate.</p>

<p>Indirectly Pitt and Dundas were responsible for these disasters.
They weakened the British force in Flanders by sending
large drafts to the West Indies, as will in due course appear.
They also allowed Corsica to be occupied in the spring of 1794,
and yet they made little or no use of that island for expeditions
against the Riviera, which the royalist natives would readily
have undertaken under an inspiring leader. They also relied too
much on the Austrians and Prussians, though the former were
known to care little for their Netherlands, apart from the prospect
of gaining the Barrier fortresses of French Flanders in
order to further the Belgic-Bavarian exchange. Above all, as
we have seen, Pitt's conduct towards Prussia was annoyingly
halting. Malmesbury's treaty could have no effect unless it led
the Prussians to move at once. The delay of sixteen days at
Whitehall must rank as one of the causes of the failures just
recounted; and though Grenville was technically guilty, Pitt
must be blamed for not ensuring the needful despatch in an all-important
decision. It is curious that he never realized his
responsibility. Speaking at a later date of the campaign of
Fleurus, he said that it turned upon as narrow a point as ever
occurred: that England was unfortunate, but the blame did not
rest with her.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> This probably refers to the surrender of Charleroi
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>and the retreat from Fleurus. But Pitt did not understand that
the timely advent of part of the Prussian force on the Meuse, or
even its advance into Lorraine, would have changed the situation;
and for their inactivity he was in some measure responsible.</p>

<p>At times Pitt lived in dreamland. On 15th July, while the
Austrians were quietly withdrawing from Central Belgium,
he drew up a Memorandum as to the course of events. By
the close of the year Austria was to bring 100,000 men into
Flanders, a close alliance being framed on the basis of her
acquisition of the French border districts (Valenciennes had not
yet surrendered). England was to retain all conquests in the
two Indies. The Prussians were to march towards Flanders,
which they obstinately refused to do. Dutch and other troops
were to be engaged by England, the presumption being that the
year 1795 would see the losses of 1794 more than retrieved.
The mistake of 10,000 in adding up the totals of the troops
(78,000 instead of 88,000) enables one to conjecture at what
time of the day this sketch was outlined.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> One would not take
it seriously had not the Foreign Office soon despatched Earl
Spencer and Mr. Thomas Grenville as special envoys to Vienna
to propose very similar plans, Austria being urged on by the
prospect of acquiring the French Barrier fortresses from Lille
to Sedan.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>They aroused in Thugut a spirit of greed, not of honourable
emulation. In a private letter to Pitt, dated Vienna 16th
August, Spencer warned him that that Government was "neither
possessed of sufficient energy and vigour, nor sufficiently actuated
by the true principles on which the cause in which we are
engaged ought to be conducted" to justify the demands of
Thugut. They included British subsidies for Austria, though
she could well support the war, and the sacrifice of British
maritime conquests at the general peace as a means of ensuring
the recovery of her losses on land. As to Belgium, added
Spencer, Thugut looked on it "as irrecoverably lost and not worth
regaining, unless with the addition of a very strong and extended
barrier, composed of fortresses which he to-day plainly told us
he did not think there was the least chance of taking in the
course of the war, but that they must be obtained as cessions
from France at the peace."<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Thus Thugut expected that, while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>the Austrians were ignominiously evacuating the Netherlands,
the British fleet should win French colonies valuable enough to
induce France both to retire from Belgium, and to surrender
to Austria her northern fortresses from Lille to Sedan or
Thionville.</p>

<p>The capture of Valenciennes and the slaughter of the <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span>
in the Austrian garrison was the retort of the French to these
day-dreams (29th August). The fall of Robespierre a month
earlier, and the enhanced authority now enjoyed by Carnot
enabled the authorities at Paris to press on the conquest of Belgium
with an energy which set at defiance the boyish miscalculations
of Pitt and the wavering plans of the Hapsburgs.</p>

<p>Towards the close of July Pitt and Grenville saw the need of
abating the rigour of their demands on Prussia. For of what
use was it to move 60,000 Prussians more than 100 miles to
defend West Flanders when that province was lost? Malmesbury
therefore was empowered to pay the monthly subsidy of &pound;50,000
on behalf of Great Britain and Holland, provided that M&ouml;llendorf's
army attacked the French about Tr&egrave;ves, thus lessening
the pressure on Coburg's left wing. On 27th July he framed
such an agreement with Hardenberg. This statesman was
destined to be one of the saviours of the Prussian State in its
darkest days, 1810&ndash;12; but now, as always, his conduct was shifty;
and it is questionable whether he, any more than Haugwitz,
dealt honourably with England. It must suffice to say that
M&ouml;llendorf made not even a demonstration towards Tr&egrave;ves. His
inactivity was in part due to the withdrawal of several regiments
towards Poland, though Great Britain and Holland still paid for
the maintenance of the full quota on the Rhine.</p>

<p>So flagrant was the breach of faith as to elicit heated protests
from Malmesbury; and Pitt, justly indignant at the use of
British money for what was virtually a partition of Poland, decided
to remonstrate with Jacobi, the Prussian ambassador at
London. Summoning him to Downing Street, at the end of
September, he upbraided him with this dishonourable conduct,
declaring that, unless the Prussians moved forward at once, the
British and Dutch subsidy for October would be withheld.
Much as we may sympathize with this indignant outburst, we
must pronounce it unwise. For firstly, Pitt was intruding upon
the sphere of Grenville in making this declaration, which was
far more acrid than the despatches of the Foreign Secretary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Secondly, it was made in the presence of Dundas, with whom
Grenville was already on bad terms. Is it surprising that the
Foreign Secretary wrote sharply to Pitt protesting against his
acting on a line different from that previously taken at Downing
Street? In his despatch of 30th September to Berlin, Grenville
was careful to make the withdrawal of the subsidy strictly
conditional, and his protest was probably less sharp than that
which Pitt addressed to Jacobi.</p>

<p>So annoyed was Grenville at Pitt's interference during his
own temporary absence that he wrote to express his willingness
to retire from the Foreign Office if this would solve the difficulties
caused by the appointment of Earl Fitzwilliam to the
Irish Viceroyalty. To that topic I shall recur in a later chapter
on the Irish troubles which now became acute. Here it must
suffice to say that Pitt declined to accept Grenville's offer, and
affairs at Downing Street righted themselves.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> But at Berlin the
mischief was irremediable. Jacobi, a born intriguer, and ever
hostile to England, represented the words of Pitt in the worst
possible light. Accordingly Frederick William affected great
indignation at the conduct of Pitt, accused him of ending the
alliance, and discovered in his own ruffled feelings the pretext
for giving rein to the dictates of self-interest. He gave orders
to end the campaign on the Rhine; and though Grenville sought
to patch matters up, compromise was clearly impossible between
Allies who had lost that mutual confidence which is the only
lasting guarantee of treaties.</p>

<p>At the autumnal equinox of 1794 Pitt was confronted by a
far more serious crisis than at the beginning of the war in February
1793. The Republicans, after throwing back Clerfait beyond
the River Roer, towards Aix-la-Chapelle, compelled the Duke
of York to abandon the natural line of defence of Holland,
the River Waal; and in the early days of October the British
retired behind Bergen-op-zoom and other Dutch fortresses.
These were found to be totally unprepared to sustain a siege.
The sluggishness of the Orange party, dominant in Holland
since 1787, stood in marked contrast to the eagerness of the
Dutch Patriots to help the invaders. Consequently in a few
weeks the friends of the Stadholder saw their hopes fade away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>
<p>There was but one chance of rescue. The Duke of Brunswick,
who so skilfully led the Prussians to Amsterdam in 1787,
might be expected to impart some courage to the Dutch garrisons
and some show of discipline to the disordered relics of
York's and Clerfait's forces now drifting slowly northwards. His
position as a Field-Marshal of the Prussian army also promised
to interest the Court of Berlin in recovering some part, at least,
of the supremacy of the Allies in the Dutch Netherlands. As
the crisis in Holland had served to unite the two great Protestant
Powers, so now it might prevent the dissolution of that salutary
compact. Further, George&nbsp;III, though greatly disliking the
substitution of Cornwallis for the Duke of York, favoured the
appointment of the veteran Brunswick to the supreme command.
Family considerations, always very strong in the King,
here concurred with reasons of state. Not only had Brunswick
married the sister of George&nbsp;III; but their daughter, the Princess
Caroline, was now the reluctant choice of the Prince of Wales.
The parents, both at Windsor and at Brunswick welcomed the
avowal by the royal prodigal of the claims of lawful wedlock.
The Duchess of Brunswick fell into raptures at the brilliant
prospects thus opened out for her daughter; and it seemed that
both Hymen and Mars, for once working in unison, conspired to
bring from his inglorious retreat at Brunswick the man whom
that age still acclaimed as its war-lord.</p>

<p>Malmesbury therefore proceeded to Brunswick for the double
purpose of arranging the marriage and urging the Duke to take
the command of the allied forces on the Lower Rhine. Overjoyed
at leaving the atmosphere of intrigue at M&ouml;llendorf's
headquarters, the envoy journeyed into the northern plain in
hopes of assuring the safety of part of Holland. Early in
November Pitt and his colleagues received a refusal from the
Duke, but now they sent through Malmesbury an offer to subsidize
a corps of 20,000 or 30,000 Austrians in that quarter.
These, along with the British, Hanoverian, and Hessian troops,
when marshalled by Brunswick, might surely be trusted to stay
the French advance. The crisis was momentous. Brunswick
well understood that in reality the fate of North Germany was
at stake; for the French, if masters of the Rhine and Ems
valleys, could easily overrun the northern plain, including his
own duchy. Self-interest, pride in the German name, hatred of
French principles, and, finally, satisfaction at the marriage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
alliance, bade the Duke draw his sword before it was too
late.</p>

<p>But here again the malign influence of Berlin thwarted the
plans of Pitt. In vain did Malmesbury ply the Duke with arguments
and the Duchess with compliments. On 25th November
the Duke informed him that, as a Prussian Field-Marshal, he
was bound to consult Frederick William: and "the answer he
had received was not of a nature which allowed him to accept
of an offer otherwise so highly honourable and flattering to him."
He then handed to the envoy his formal refusal.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>Whether the elderly Duke of Brunswick could have withstood
the impetuous onset of the ill-clad, half-starved, but unconquerable
peasants now following the French tricolour in its progress
through Holland, who shall say? The exploits of Pichegru and
his levies border on the miraculous until we remember that half
of the Dutch laboured on their behalf, while the troops of York
and Clerfait distrusted or despised those leaders. This consideration
it was that led Pitt to take a step which he deemed most
necessary for the public service as well as for the reputation of
the Duke of York. On Sunday, 25th November, he wrote at
Holwood a very lengthy letter to the King, setting forth most
deferentially the reasons which impelled him and his colleagues
to request the withdrawal of the Duke from Holland.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> He
touched with equal skill and firmness on the unfortunate feeling
prevalent in the army respecting the Duke of York; and, while
eulogizing His Royal Highness, expressed the conviction of the
Cabinet that, in his own interests as well as those of the country,
he should be recalled from a sphere of action where the difficulties
were wellnigh insuperable. Pitt also suggested to the
King the advisability of transferring the British forces to a more
promising sphere, Brittany or la Vend&eacute;e. The King's answer
evinced considerable irritation, a proof that he saw little but the
personal aspects of the case. Pitt, however, held to his point,
and the Duke was recalled in order to become a little later
commander-in-chief, a position for which he was far better
suited than for a command in the field. At the close of the year
Pitt showed his regard for the public service by requesting from
the King leave to displace his brother, the Earl of Chatham,
from the Admiralty, where his lethargy had several times
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>hindered the naval operations. Lord Spencer became First Lord,
the Earl of Chatham succeeding to Spencer's position as Lord
Privy Seal.</p>

<p>Pitt's magnanimous resolve to brave the royal displeasure
rather than keep a royal prince in a situation for which he was
unfit met with general approval. The times were too serious
to admit of pedantic trifling or unmanly shrinking. In quick
succession there arrived news of the definite refusal of the Duke
of Brunswick to come forward, of the incredible apathy of the
Dutch, and of the demoralization of the Allies in their continued
retreat. To add to their misfortunes, nature gripped that
land of waters in a severe frost, so that the Dutch loyalists were
unable, even if they had the hardihood, to let loose the floods
against the invaders. In endless swarms these pressed on from
the South, determined now to realize Dumouriez' dream of conquering
Holland in order to appropriate its resources, pecuniary,
naval, and colonial. Pichegru it was who won immortal fame by
this conquest, which in truth needs not the legendary addition
of his cavalry seizing a Dutch squadron in the Zuyder Zee. A
singular incident attended the journey of Malmesbury with the
future Princess of Wales towards Helvoetsluys, on their way to
England. Unaware of the inroads of the French horse, they had
to beat a speedy retirement, which, unfortunately for the Prince
of Wales, placed them out of reach of the raiders. A little later
the Duke and Duchess of Brunswick were fain to pack up their
valuables and leave their capital in haste.</p>

<p>Such was the French conquest of Holland and part of
Hanover in the winter of 1794&ndash;5. So speedy was it that Pitt
and Dundas took no timely means to ensure the carrying off
the Dutch fleet. As no small part of it was loyal to the Prince
of Orange, who now fled to England, the oversight is to be
censured. Surely Flushing or the Brill could have been secured.
The Cabinet, however, as we shall see later, prepared to rescue
from the general ruin the most valuable of the Dutch colonies,
the Cape of Good Hope, the importance of which, for the safety
of India, Pitt and Dundas rated most highly. Meanwhile, under
the command of Abercromby, Harcourt, Cathcart, and Walmoden,
the British and subsidized German forces fell back
towards the River Ems, and thence to the Weser. Pitt, as we
have seen, desired to recall the British regiments for service in
the West of France. But various considerations told against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
this plan; and, as will appear later, the King obstinately opposed
the withdrawal of the British cavalry from the confines of his
beloved Electorate until the autumn of 1795. In April of that
year the infantry, now reduced to some 6,000 effectives by the
rigours of winter, embarked at Bremen.</p>

<p>Thus ended an expedition unprecedentedly fatal to the British
arms. The causes of the disaster are not far to seek. The campaigns
of 1793&ndash;4 were undertaken heedlessly, in reliance upon
the strength of a Coalition which proved to have no strength,
and upon the weakness of the French Republic which proved to
be unconquerably strong. The Allies were powerful enough to
goad France to fury, too weak to crush its transports. Their ill-concealed
threats of partition bound France to the cause of the
Jacobins, which otherwise she would have abjured in horror.
Thus the would-be invaders drove France in upon herself, compelled
her to organize her strength to the utmost; and that
strength, when marshalled by Carnot, was destined to shatter
the Coalition and overrun neighbouring lands. She then learnt
the fatal secret that she could conquer Europe.</p>

<p>In <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">a later chapter</a> I propose to survey Pitt's conduct as War
Minister. Here I need only point out that his mistakes resulted
mainly from his unquenchable hopefulness. A singular proof of
this admirable but dangerous quality is seen in his effort during
the months of February and March 1795 to frame one more plan
of co-operation with the Court of Berlin, which had so cynically
deceived him. To this proposal Grenville offered unflinching
opposition, coupled with a conditional threat to resign. Pitt
persuaded him to defer action until the troubles in Ireland were
less acute. But the King finally agreed with Pitt, and Grenville
was on the point of retiring when news arrived of the defection
of Prussia.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> For some time she had been deep in negotiations
with France, which had the approval of M&ouml;llendorf and the
officers of her Rhenish army.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> The upshot of it all was a treaty,
which Hardenberg signed with the French envoy at Basle on
5th April 1795. By this discreditable bargain Frederick William
of Prussia enabled France to work her will on the lands west of
the Rhine, on condition of his acquiring a general ascendancy
over North and Central Germany, which now became neutral in
the strife. Austria and the South German States remained at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>war with France for two years longer, by which time the tottering
Germanic System fell beneath the sword of Napoleon
Bonaparte.</p>

<p>Prussia's bargain with France marks a reversion to her traditional
policy, which viewed that Power as the friend and Austria
as the enemy. It undid the life-work of Prince Kaunitz, now
nearing his end at Vienna, and left the Hapsburg States enfeebled.
True, they had a profitable share in the third and last
Partition of Poland, which soon ensued; but this scarcely made
good the loss in prestige due to the undisputed hegemony of
Prussia in the greater part of Germany. The House of Hohenzollern,
impelled by men like Lucchesini, Haugwitz, and Hardenberg,
took the easy and profitable course and plumed itself on
over-reaching its secular rival at Vienna. In reality it sealed the
doom not only of the truly conservative policy of Pitt, but of
the European fabric. Prussia it was which enabled the Jacobins
to triumph and to extend their sway over neighbouring lands.
The example of Berlin tempted Spain three months later to sign
degrading terms of peace with France, and thus to rob England
of her gains in Hayti and Corsica. Thanks to Prussia and Spain,
France could enter upon that career of conquest in Italy which
assured the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte and the temporary ruin
of Austria. The mistakes of Pitt were great; but, after all, they
might have been retrieved were it not for the torpor of the
Viennese Court and the treachery of Prussia.</p>

<p class="title spaced">THE WEST INDIES</p>

<p class="quote">Unfortunately, the war was carried on on the old principle of almost undivided
attention to what was termed British interests&mdash;that is, looking to
and preferring the protection of trade and the capture of the enemy's
colonial establishments rather than to the objects which had involved Great
Britain in the contest with France.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Colonel Thomas Graham's</span> <i>Diary</i>.</p>


<p>If we try to picture the course of the war as mapped out by
Pitt, it would probably have appeared somewhat as follows.
Great Britain, after lending to the Dutch a few regiments as a
protection against the threatened raid of Dumouriez, withdraws
them, leaving the Dutch and the subsidized German corps to
guard the rear of the legions of Prussia and Austria during their
conquering march to Paris. England, in the meantime, harasses
the coasts of France, thereby compelling her to detain considerable
forces at the important points, and further cripples her
by sweeping her fleets and merchantmen from the sea and seizing
her colonies.</p>

<p>In short, Pitt's conception of the true function of Great Britain
in a continental war was based on that of his father, who accorded
comparatively little military aid to Frederick the Great even in his
direst need, but helped him indirectly by subsidies and by naval
expeditions that stalemated no small portion of the French army.
If Chatham's tactics succeeded when Prussia was striving against
France, Austria, and Russia, how much more might Pitt hope to
win a speedy triumph over anarchic France during her struggle
with Austria, Prussia, Spain, Naples, Sardinia, and Holland? He
expected, and he had a right to expect, that these States would
need British money, not British troops, while the Sea Power restricted
its operations to a "minor offensive" along the seaboards
of France and her colonies. Pitt's efforts in this direction
were constantly thwarted by the drain of men to Flanders; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
his letters to Murray, Chief of Staff to the Duke of York, evince
his anxiety to strike at Toulon and the West Indies, and not
merely to lighten the military duties of Austria and Prussia
on the French borders.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> It would be tedious to recount his
various attempts to prepare an expedition for the West Indies.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
Of more interest are the requests for protection which he received
from the French colonists of Hayti, the western part of
the great island of San Domingo.</p>

<p>As appeared in Chapter&nbsp;XX of the former volume, the decrees
of the National Assembly of Paris fired the negroes of the French
West Indies with the resolve to claim the liberty and equality
now recklessly promised by the mother-land. The white settlers,
on the contrary, having recently acquired autonomous rights,
disputed the legality of that levelling legislation, and rejected all
authority but that of Louis&nbsp;XVI. Amidst the ensuing strifes, the
chief colonies, especially Hayti, were menaced by that most horrible
of all commotions, a servile revolt, when, most opportunely, help
arrived from Jamaica. The contrast between the timely succour
of England and the reckless iconoclasm of Paris struck the imagination
of the French settlers, and the Assembly of Hayti forthwith
drew up a declaration, setting forth the illegality of the French
decrees, the miseries resulting from them, and the resolve of the
colonists to sever a connection absolutely fatal to their welfare.
Citing the example of the United States fifteen years before, and
recounting the misdeeds of the mother country, they proclaimed
to the world the justice of the act of severance.</p>

<p>A copy of this declaration, signed by de Cadusey on 27th
September 1791, was sent forthwith to Pitt, with a request for
the protection of Great Britain. He received it at Burton Pynsent
on 27th October.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> One of the chief delegates from Hayti
was de Charmilly, who on 14th November sought an interview
with Pitt, and a fortnight later wrote to him, earnestly begging
the help of the only nation which could avert ruin from those
islands. France, he declared, had passed a decree of blood
against her own colonies and was powerless to stop its effects.
The National Assembly, having by its annexation of Avignon
recognized the right of that papal district to belong to whom it
would, Hayti of equal right now voted for union with England.
He further advised that its ports should remain open to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>all nations, a course of action which would herald the dawn of
commercial and political freedom among the Spanish colonies of
the New World.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> These alluring prospects failed to entice Pitt
from the strict neutrality to which he had pledged himself. So
far was he from desiring to profit by the misfortunes of France,
as the French princes first, and after them the Jacobins, maliciously
asserted.</p>

<p>Once more the deputies of France flung the torch of discord
across the Atlantic. By their decree of 4th April 1792 they declared
absolute equality of rights between whites, half-castes,
and blacks, and sent out commissioners to enforce this anarchic
fiat. They forthwith took the side of the rebels, who in Toussaint
l'Ouverture found a leader of terrible force of will. Martinique
and Guadeloupe and the smaller islands were also a prey to
civil war. In sheer desperation the planters and merchants of
Guadeloupe sent over a delegate, Curt, to appeal to the British
Government for protection. Lord Hawkesbury accorded to him
an informal interview in the closing days of 1792. Curt pressed
him for official help, without which his fellow colonists must lose
their lives and property, and declared that he and many others
abjured the name of Frenchmen.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Malouet, once prominent in
the National Assembly and destined to become famous under
Napoleon, also approached our Ministers, but with more caution.
He knew that in some of the islands the Republic had many
adherents; but after the outbreak of war in February 1793 he
too advocated the sovereignty of Great Britain under certain
conditions, and on behalf of the colonists of Hayti signed a compact
with Dundas to that effect.</p>

<p>Fear of a revolt of the slaves had induced Ministers to send
out reinforcements, so that, early in 1793, 19 battalions were in
the British West Indies. In the month of April a small British
force easily captured Tobago and restored that valuable little
island to Great Britain. An attack on Martinique at midsummer
was, however, a failure. These attempts, it may be noted, were
made with forces already in the West Indies.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> Pitt and Dundas
have been severely blamed for sending further reinforcements to
the West Indies.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> But a letter which Pitt wrote to Grenville
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>some time in June or July 1793 shows that the news of a French
expedition having set sail to the West Indies, escorted by six or
seven sail-of-the-line from Brest, led him to urge the despatch of
a force for the protection of that important group of colonies.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>Besides, was a forward policy in the West Indies unwise? In
these days it is hard to realize the value of those islands. The
mention of Hayti conjures up a vision as of a ship manned
by gorillas; for there and in Liberia is seen the proneness of
the negroes to aimless lounging varied by outbursts of passion.
But in the year 1789 Hayti far surpassed Jamaica in wealth and
activity. The French possessed only the western third of the
island; but the Spanish portion to the east was far less fertile,
and far worse cultivated. The French genius for colonization was
seen in the excellent system of irrigation carried on in the vast
and fertile plain, the <span lang="fr">Cul-de-Sac</span>, east of the capital, Port-au-Prince.
But other portions, notably the long peninsula to the
south-west, were also highly prosperous. The chief towns
equalled in splendour and activity the provincial cities of France.
Port-au-Prince and Cap Fran&ccedil;ais were the pride of the West
Indies; and the rocky fortress, Mole St. Nicholas, dominated
those waters as Gibraltar dominates the Eastern Mediterranean.
The population of Hayti was reckoned at 40,000 whites, 60,000
mulattoes or half-castes, and some 500,000 negro slaves. Its exports
(chiefly sugar, coffee, and cotton) were assessed at upwards
of &pound;7,500,000, or more by one third than that of all the British
West Indies. To some extent Jamaica flourished on its ruin.
For in May 1796 an official report stated that two coffee-planters,
refugees from Hayti, who had settled in the mountains
behind Port Royal, were introducing so many improvements as
to bring the exports of coffee up to 6,000,000 lb.; and they
would soon amount to 50,000,000 lb.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>The colonists of Hayti, who offered this valuable prize to
Great Britain, were far from being unprincipled adventurers.
Malouet, on whom fell the chief responsibility, was an upright
and able man; and both he and his comrades were deputed by
representative Assemblies which sought to save society from
sinking into a gulf of unutterable horrors. His letters to
Pitt<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> are instinct with the conviction that the men of Hayti
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>unanimously desired a British protectorate, and recognized that
the colonists must pay for the support accorded to them. As
we were framing an alliance with Spain, no difficulties were to
be anticipated from the Spanish part of that island. When five
or six valuable islands were to be had, to all appearance with
little risk except from the slaves, Ministers would have been
craven in the extreme not to push on an enterprise which promised
to benefit British commerce and cripple that of France.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, owing to the drain of the Flemish campaign,
their action was tardy. The schisms between Royalists and Republicans
at the city of Cap Fran&ccedil;ais enabled the negroes to
burst in at midsummer of 1793 with fire and knife and glut
their vengeance on some thousands of persons. Even after these
atrocities the Jacobin commissioners continued to make use of
the blacks in order to enforce their levelling decree; and the
year ended amid long drawn out scenes of murder, rape, and
pillage. By these infamous means did democracy win its triumph
in the West Indies.</p>

<p>In their despair the French loyalists applied for further aid to
Major-General Williamson, the governor of Jamaica. He sent
a force which received a hearty welcome at the little fortress of
J&eacute;r&eacute;mie (19th September), and a few days later at that important
stronghold, Mole St. Nicholas, then blockaded on land
by the blacks. An attempt by the Republicans at the capital,
Port-au-Prince, to send an expedition for the recapture of Mole
St. Nicholas was thwarted; and late in the year 1793 five other
towns accepted British protection. The rapid recovery of prosperity
in the district forming the lower jaw of the griffin-like
head of Hayti is seen in the official exports from the port of
Grand Anse at its tip. During the quarter 20th September to
31st December 1793 it sent the following quantities to British
ports, chiefly Kingston in Jamaica: Coffee, 644,751 lb.; Sugar,
91,593 lb.; Cotton, 56,339 lb.; Cocoa, 66,944 lb. Even larger
quantities of coffee were exported to foreign ports.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> In 1796
the produce of Hayti was valued at &pound;1,500,000; the colony
employed more than 400 ships.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Was not this a land for which
some risks might be encountered?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile the Spaniards from their part of the island had
overrun certain districts, especially those to the north of Port-au-Prince.
In particular, they for a time occupied the port of
Gonaives, about midway between the capital and Mole St. Nicholas,
a step almost as threatening to the British forces as to
the French Republicans. It is hard to fathom the designs of the
Spaniards at this time. Their pride, their hereditary claims to
the whole of the Indies, and their nearness to this splendid
prize, all urged them on to an effort from which lack of men,
ships and money, and the hatred of the French and the blacks
to their sway should have warned them off. Seeing also that
the French colonists had officially handed over their possession
to Great Britain, Spain should have come to some understanding
with her Ally before invading what was now in effect British
territory. She did not do so; and subsequent events proved that
her King and statesmen harboured deep resentment against the
transfer, and sought to thwart it by underhand means. For the
present, however, their inroad into the north-central districts
dealt one more blow to the power of the French Jacobins and
their black friends. These last were formidable only when the
quest was plunder. Even the iron will of their ablest leader,
Toussaint l'Ouverture, could infuse no steadiness into the swarthy
levies, which, roving almost at will in the mountainous interior,
were wellnigh as dangerous to the Republicans as to the British.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>It is not surprising, then, that Pitt and Dundas, despite the
drain of ships and men to Ostend and Toulon, did all in their
power to secure this colony, which had always been deemed
essential to the prosperity of French commerce. On 11th
October 1793 Pitt reluctantly admitted the need of further
postponing the West India expedition owing to the uncertainty
of the fate of Ostend and the chance of a French raid on our
shores. But when these dangers passed away the original plan
held the first place; and it should be noted that, by the middle
of November, when the expedition was finally decided on, the
position of the Royalists at Toulon was thought to be satisfactory.
Much, of course, can be urged against sending troops so far
away, when the loyal Bretons needed succour; but Pitt, Grenville,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
and, still more, Dundas were bent on this colonial enterprise;
and, viewing the situation as it then was, not as we with
our knowledge of later events see it, their decision seems
defensible.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>On 26th November, then, Sir John Jervis (afterwards Earl of
St. Vincent) set sail with some 7,000 troops commanded by Sir
Charles Grey. After touching at Barbados he made for Martinique
and succeeded in reducing that island by 22nd March
1794. St. Lucia, Guadeloupe, Marie Galante, and the Saintes
surrendered in April, but after struggles which showed that the
Republicans, backed by mulattoes and blacks, were formidable
foes. This anarchic combination was already threatening the
small and scattered British garrisons in San Domingo. But,
when further reinforcements from England reached Mole St.
Nicholas, a force detached thence under Major-General Whyte
made a dash upon Port-au-Prince. Vigorously handled, and
under cover of a violent thunderstorm, the landing parties carried
an important outwork in handsome style, and thus assured the
surrender of the whole place. The spoils were 101 cannon and
32 ships, with cargoes worth about half a million sterling (4th
June 1794). This brilliant success cost the assailants very few
lives; but the heats of the summer and probably also the intemperance
of the troops soon thinned their ranks. The French,
too, having received succours which slipped out from Rochefort,
recovered Guadeloupe in the month of September.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> And from
this point of vantage they sought, often with success, to stir up
the slaves in the British islands.</p>

<p>Thus by the autumn of 1794 the position was somewhat as
follows. The British had secured all the French colonies in the
West Indies, excepting Guadeloupe. In Hayti they held nearly
all the coast towns, and maintained an intermittent blockade
over the others; but their position was precarious owing to the
thinness of their garrisons, the untrustworthiness of their mulatto
auxiliaries, and the ravages of disease. It seems probable that,
with ordinary precautions and some reinforcements, the garrisons
might have held out in the towns then occupied, provided that
the fleet intercepted French expeditions destined for the West
Indies; and this ought to have been possible after Howe's
victory of 1st June 1794. The fact that the Republic strenuously
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>prepared to regain those islands at the very time when the
Coalition in Europe and the revolt in Brittany threatened its
existence, suffices to justify Pitt and his colleagues in attacking
France in that quarter. A colony which is worth regaining must
be worth gaining. To the capture of Louisburg, a weaker stronghold
than Mole St. Nicholas, England devoted several expeditions
a generation earlier. Had Pitt and Dundas declined to
have as a gift this key to the Indies, what would not their critics
have said of their incapacity and cowardice? For the West
Indies were then far more highly prized than Canada.</p>

<p>Endless difficulties beset every expedition to the tropics, even
when forethought and care minimize the risks from disease. The
story of England's ventures in those seas is, in general, one of
hasty action and long repentance. No one had made a special
study of the needs of white men in that climate. In fact, the
military martinets of those days made little allowance for the
altered conditions of service under a broiling sun; and, until the
advent of Abercromby, only slight changes took place either in
the uniform or the time of drills. Dr. Pinckard, in his account of
this enterprise, mentions cases of gross stupidity, slovenliness,
and even of dishonesty on the part of army officials in those
colonies;<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> and it is clear that to this cause the long death-roll
was largely due. The following figures at the close of 1794 are
instructive:<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>It will be observed that the French and coloured troops were
far more immune from sickness. Indeed, the loyal French
colonists felt much annoyance at the comparative uselessness of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>the British force at this time. Charmilly, after a long visit to
Hayti, returned to London in September 1794, and laid stress
on this in several letters to Pitt. On 11th October he urges
him to sanction a plan (already approved) for raising a force of
French <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span> in service in Hayti. A month later he complains
that nothing is being done, though the loyalists of Hayti are
willing to pay their share of the expenses. As it is, they are
growing disheartened; for the British troops remain in the
strongholds, thus leaving the colonial troops in the country too
weak to cope with the roving bands of brigands. As for himself,
he is weary of soliciting help which is never vouchsafed; and
he warns Pitt that opinion is gaining ground in Hayti as to the
uselessness of maintaining a struggle in which the British people
take no interest. The note of egotism rarely absent from Charmilly's
letters appears in his assurance that, if something is not
done soon, England will lose the splendid possession which he
has placed in her hand.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>There were good reasons why Pitt and his colleagues should
not commit themselves deeply to the Haytian embroglio. In
that anxious time, the autumn of 1794, the most urgent needs
were to save Holland from the Jacobins, to distract them by
helping the Royalists of Brittany, and from our new base in
Corsica to clog their attempts at an invasion of Italy. Owing
to the slackness of our Allies, these enterprises proved unexpectedly
difficult. In truth any two of them would have
strained the scanty resources of the British army; and Pitt is
open to censure for not ruling out all but the most essential of
them. But here a word of caution is needful. For us, with our
knowledge of the sequel, it is a comparatively easy task to
assess the gains and losses of the war, and to blame perseverance
in one course as wasteful folly or backwardness in another
as stupid slothfulness. If later critics would seek to realize
the amount of information possessed by fallible mortals at the
time of their decisions, the world would be spared floods of
censure. How was Pitt to know that the Dutch were about to
hamper, rather than assist, the defence of their land by the
Allies; that Prussia would play him false; that the schisms
among the French Royalists would make Quiberon a word of
horror; that Paoli would stir up strife in Corsica; or that Spain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>was preparing to ruin British rule in Hayti? With loyal cooperation
on the part of the Allies, all these enterprises might
have proceeded successfully side by side.</p>

<p>There were no solid reasons for distrusting Spain. The Court
of Madrid had eagerly taken up arms against the regicides of
Paris; and Pitt, as we shall see, early sought to avoid friction in
the West Indies. Otherwise, he would be highly blameable;
for England's easy acquisition of Hayti could not but ruffle
the feelings of the Dons. No chord in the highly strung nature
of the Spaniard vibrates so readily and so powerfully as that
of pride in the retention or recovery of the conquests of his
ancestors. The determination of the Court of Madrid to win
back Louisiana and the Floridas, not to speak of Minorca, had
potently influenced its policy in the recent past, and the prospect
of seeing the Union Jack wave over Hayti and Corsica now
envenomed the ever open wound of Gibraltar. True, the French
colonists of Hayti, acting through their local Assemblies, had
the right to will away their land to England. Spain, at least,
could not say them nay; but none the less she longed to see her
flag float once more over the western districts which had slipped
from her grasp.</p>

<p>Pitt and Grenville had early foreseen trouble ahead with Spain
on the subject of the West Indies. When affairs at Toulon were
causing friction, Grenville instructed Lord St. Helens, British
ambassador at Madrid, to urge that Court to secure the hoped-for
indemnities in the French districts north of the Pyrenees.
As for England, she had in view Hayti and certain of the
French Leeward Islands. This plan, continued Grenville, could
not offend Spain, seeing that the Haytian or western part of
San Domingo fronted Jamaica and fell naturally to the Power
holding that island. But, as the Court of Madrid was known to
cherish desires for a part of Hayti, St. Helens must endeavour
to ascertain their extent so as to come to a friendly compromise.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>
The Spanish Government, at that time incensed by the quarrels
at Toulon, vouchsafed no reply to these courteous overtures.
They were renewed during the year 1794, but with no better
result.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Don Garcia, the Spanish Governor of San
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>Domingo sought to pour oil on the flames of civil strife. He
allowed the bands of negroes to retire into the Spanish districts,
and replenish their stores. In fact, his conduct was so openly
hostile to England, that on 11th November 1794 Grenville instructed
Jackson, British <span lang="fr">charg&eacute; d'affaires</span> at Madrid, to demand
the recall of that arrogant official.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Charmilly also averred that
the brigands often sallied forth from Spanish territory to ravage
the western districts.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> Other facts point in the same direction.
Whence could the Republicans and their black allies have gained
supplies of arms and ammunition but from the Spaniards? The
survey of the British over the western coasts was close enough
to bar those supplies, at least in the quantities that the negroes
demanded. In truth, the enigmas of the Hayti affair can be solved
only by delving in the Spanish archives. The whole question is
closely connected with the extraordinary change that came over
Anglo-Spanish relations in the years 1795&ndash;6, a topic which will
be treated in the <a href="#CHAPTER_X">following chapter</a>.</p>

<p class="title spaced">SPAIN AND HAYTI</p>

<p class="quote">Are not Martinique, Mole St. Nicholas, and the Cape of Good Hope most
important conquests?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pitt</span>, <i>Speech of 9th December 1795</i>.</p>


<p>More than once it has happened that, after a time of
national revival, Spain has fallen under the dominion of a
ruler led by wrongheaded counsellors and intriguing favourites.
Such was the case in the year 1788. Charles&nbsp;III, who then
passed away, had restored the finances, the prosperity, the navy,
and the prestige of that land. But his successor, Charles&nbsp;IV,
proved to be one of the weakest and most indolent members of
that dynasty. Fond of display, and devoted to the pleasures of
the chase and the table, he squandered the resources of the
State, and soon saw his finances fall into hopeless confusion.
Worse still, his consort, a princess of the ducal House of Parma,
and a woman of much energy, conceived a violent passion for
Manuel Godoy, a young private in the royal guards, on whom
she heaped favours and dignities, so that he forced his way into
the highest circles with the title Duke of Alcudia. He was endowed
with a dignified mien, handsome features, affable manners,
and good abilities, so that the British ambassador, Lord
St. Helens, happily characterized him as a Birmingham Villiers.
The measure of his importance and of the degradation of the
Sovereigns may be gauged from the fact that the paramour of
the Queen became the chief Minister of the King. In truth, the
Queen, her lover, and her two confessors governed Spain.</p>

<p>The habits of the favourite were as follows. He rose early, drove
or rode for an hour, and after breakfast transacted business for
a time. He then relieved the tedium of that time by witnessing
exhibitions of skill and daring by his private matadors,
after which he spent about three hours in the society of the
Queen. He then devoted the same length of time to the conduct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
of public business with the King; and the day ended with
dinner, f&ecirc;tes, the opera, or the consideration of requests for
patronage. This function of State generally occupied three
evenings in the week; and on these occasions a crowd of some
250 suitors filled his meanly lit ante-room with jealous expectancy
and long baffled hopes.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>Certainly the representatives of monarchy at this time of
acute trial were unequal to the strain. Catharine of Russia was
supremely able, but no less corrupt. Frederick William of
Prussia equalled her in vice and in nothing else. Francis of
Austria had the brain of a master of ceremonies; George&nbsp;III
that of a model squire; Ferdinand of Naples was in his place in
the kennel; Victor Amadeus of Sardinia, in the confessional. It
is difficult to say to what place Charles&nbsp;IV of Spain and his
consort can most fitly be assigned; for they could not live apart
from Godoy; and with Godoy they would have been excluded
from any residence but the royal palace of Spain. The policy of
that Court wavered under his whims and devices. Hated by the
grandees, loathed by honest people, and yet fawned on by all
alike, he sought to strengthen his power by jobbery, with results
fatal to the public services. Such a man evades difficulties instead
of grappling with them. He lives for the day. "After me
the deluge" is the motto of all Godoys.</p>

<p>The favourite soon perceived that the war with France pleased
neither the Court, the merchants, nor the people. Charles&nbsp;IV
had gone to war for the restoration of royalty; but, thanks to
the perfidy of Prussia and the vacillations of Austria, that ideal
had vanished; and in its place there appeared the spectres of
want and bankruptcy. By the end of 1794 the Republicans had
gained a firm foothold in Catalonia and Biscay; and the prospect
of further campaigns was highly distasteful to a Court which kept
up the traditional pomp of the Spanish monarchy. Even when
the Spanish forces in Catalonia and Biscay were wellnigh
starving, the Court borrowed &pound;160,000 to defray the expenses
of the usual migration to San Ildefonso; and the British ambassador
computed that the cost of a campaign could be saved
by a sojourn in Madrid for the whole year. But parsimony such
as this was out of the question. Accordingly the only possible
alternatives were, peace with France, an issue of paper money,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>or a bankruptcy. Godoy inclined strongly to peace, and discovered
in Anglophobia a means of betraying the French
House of Bourbon. England, so he averred, had entered on the
war solely for her own aggrandisement, with the view of appropriating
first Dunkirk, then Toulon, and, failing them, Corsica
and Hayti, to the manifest detriment of Spain. The argument
was specious; for Pitt's resolve to cripple France by colonial
conquests necessarily tended to re-awaken the old jealousies of
the Spaniards; and herein, as in other respects, the son had to
confront difficulties unknown in the days of his father. The task
of the elder Pitt was simple compared with that of humouring
and spurring on five inert and yet jealous Allies.</p>

<p>Among them Spain was not the least slothful and exacting.
After the quarrels between Langara and Hood at Toulon, the
despatches from Madrid to London were full of complaints.
Now it was the detention of Danish vessels carrying naval
stores, ostensibly for Cadiz, but in reality, as we asserted, for
Rochefort. Now it was the seizure and condemnation of a
Spanish merchantman, the "Sant' Iago," on a somewhat similar
charge. England had equal cause for annoyance. The embers
of the quarrel of 1790 were once more fanned to a flame by
Spanish officials. Captain Vancouver, of H.M.S. "Discovery,"
while on a voyage to survey the island which now bears his
name, had his ship and crew detained and ill-treated at Monterey
Bay by the Governor of California. The Court of St. James
warmly protested against this conduct as contrary to the
Nootka Sound Convention of 1790; and thereby inflamed that
still open wound. Valdez, Minister of Marine, the only rival of
Godoy, now openly avowed his hostility to England. Early in
February 1795, in a conference with the King, he hotly denounced
British designs in Corsica and Hayti. Thenceforth there was no
hope of securing the co-operation of the Spanish fleet for the
blockade of Toulon and other duties too exacting for Admiral
Hotham's squadron. On 11th February Godoy handed to Jackson,
our <span lang="fr">charg&eacute; d'affaires</span>, a state paper containing the assurance
that Spain desired to continue the struggle against France; but
"if His Christian Majesty finds another road less dangerous
than that which he follows, he will take it with the dignity becoming
his rank; he will exhaust the means he may have till he
shall obtain the welfare of his people; but he will not look on
their annihilation with indifference, if those who have a similar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
interest vary the mode of pursuing it." In plain language this
meant that, as Prussia was then treating with France, Spain
would follow her example when she thought fit.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>Thereafter the Spanish Ministers either manifested sullen
reserve or indulged in petulant complaints respecting the "Sant'
Iago," Corsica, and Hayti. The conduct of the Marquis del
Campo at London was equally sinister; his despatches represented
the policy and conduct of England in the darkest colours.
In the hope of softening these asperities Pitt and Grenville
decided to send the Earl of Bute to Madrid in place of Jackson,
who desired to escape from the insolences of that capital. Thus
by one of the subtle ironies of history, the son of Chatham
despatched to the Court of Madrid the son of the man who
thwarted Chatham's aims respecting that same Power. Bute's
instructions (dated 5th April) bade him humour that Court, but
none the less look out for any signs of a Franco-Spanish compact,
and discover at what place in the Spanish colonies a blow
might be dealt with most effect.</p>

<p>On 13th April, after receiving news of a Spanish success in
Catalonia, Grenville urged Bute to re-awaken Castilian pride by
holding out the prospect of gains beyond the Pyrenees, and
expressed the hope that Spain might renew her treaty with
England, promising also to consider her claims to parts of
the north-west of Hayti. These hopes were futile. Early in
that year France and Spain began to draw close together. The
more moderate Republicans, Siey&egrave;s, Boissy d'Anglas, and
Cambac&eacute;r&egrave;s, let it be known that France would offer moderate
terms. Barth&eacute;lemy, the able French envoy in Switzerland,
furthered these plans, which came near to fulfilment when
Prussia signed with France the Treaty of Basle (5th April 1795).
Charles&nbsp;IV was only waiting for some excuse to follow suit. As
a relative of Louis&nbsp;XVI, he scrupled to take the lead; but he
was ready to follow the lead of Prussia. The sacrifices demanded
of him in March 1795 were considerable, viz., the province of
Guipuzcoa and San Domingo. But Bourgoing, the special
envoy to Madrid, offered a prize which far counterbalanced
these losses. He held out to Godoy the bait which in the more
skilful hands of Napoleon was destined to catch both him and
his credulous master. Portugal was to be theirs if they made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>common cause with France. Acting together, the two Latin
nations would overwhelm this "province of England," and together
they would chase the British from the Mediterranean.
That Portugal had loyally supported Spain in the monarchist
cause mattered little. In place of the costly war of principle,
Godoy sought to substitute an effort with limited liability,
effective partnership, and enormous profits. He knew not that
in entering on this broad and easy path, he assured the ruin of
Spain and the ultimate loss of her colonial empire.</p>

<p>In this secret chaffering Pitt and Grenville were worsted as
inevitably as in the similar case of the Partition of Poland. The
Power that cries "hands off" to abettors of robbery needs to
have overwhelming force at its back; but both here and on the
banks of the Vistula England was helpless. There was no
Court of Appeal. Christendom had vanished amidst the schemes
of the monarchs in the East, and under the stabs of regicides
in the West. Thus, while the champions of monarchy were
sharing the last spoils of Poland, France succeeded in detaching
Spain from the royalist league by inciting her to the plunder of
Portugal.</p>

<p>Few moves have been more mean and cowardly; though the
conduct of the Court of Madrid in this matter touches far deeper
depths of infamy. For its present position was far from hopeless.
With the help of the British fleet the progress of the
French troops towards Bilbao might have been stayed. Affairs
in Catalonia wore a hopeful aspect. England offered to recognize
the Spanish conquests in Hayti and to press for further
indemnities from France at the general peace. But all representations
were in vain. Godoy brushed them aside in order to
compass the ruin of the House of Braganza. On this enterprise
he concentrated all his faculties. He inveighed against the
invasion of Hayti by British troops. "His Britannic Majesty,"
he said, "ought to have abstained from any interference with
the island of San Domingo, upon the whole of which His
Christian Majesty had a well-founded claim; or, if any enterprize
was undertaken there by Great Britain, it should have
been in the way of auxiliary to Spain in order to restore to her
her ancient possessions in the West Indies." On other occasions
he moaned over the heavy expenses of the war, the misery of
the people, and the impossibility of resisting the superior power
of France. But his chief theme was Hayti, and he finally suggested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
that the British acquisitions in that island should be held
in trust for Louis&nbsp;XVII. He was not a little ruffled by the
reply that they belonged of right to George&nbsp;III, who would
keep them as compensation for the expenses of the war. Another
significant fact was the removal of a fine corps of French <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span>,
some 3,300 strong, from the northern provinces to Cadiz, on their
way to the West Indies.</p>

<p>At the time of the arrival of Bute at that port (25th May),
Fortune vouchsafed a few gleams of hope to the Allies. Spanish
pride having kicked against the French demands, especially
that of the province of Guipuzcoa, Bourgoing's mission proved
fruitless. The diplomatic situation also improved. In February
1795, as we have seen, Catharine&nbsp;II of Russia signed a defensive
treaty with Great Britain, to which Austria acceeded on 20th
May. Thus did Pitt replace the outworn Triple Alliance with
Prussia and Holland by a more powerful confederacy. With
these bright prospects in view, and animated by the hope of
rousing Western France from Quiberon, Pitt had a right to
expect some measure of fortitude even in the Court of Madrid.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
But Godoy remained obdurate. On 11th June, in his first interview
with Bute, he said he had no faith in Russia; the vacillations
of Austria were notorious; and Pitt was said to be about
to send Eden to Paris to sue for peace. As for Spain, she was
hard pressed; French and American emissaries had stirred up
strife in her colonies; and affairs were most "ticklish" in San
Domingo. His Government had therefore sought for a composition
(not a definite peace) with France. In fact, the war as
a whole had failed, for whereas the Allies had set themselves to
crush French principles, they had succeeded merely in uniting
the French people in one common cause. On 11th July he
promised to recall the Anglophobe Governor of San Domingo;
but he declared the island to be in so distracted a state that
both Spaniards and British would probably be expelled. He
then complained that somehow England always got the better
of Spain; witness Nootka Sound, Hayti, and Corsica. In spite
of Bute's assurance that he came to end these jealousies, Godoy
continued to drift on the tide of events. "No plan is prepared,"
wrote Bute on 11th July, "no measures are taken. The accident
of the day seems to determine everything, and happy do the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>Ministers feel when the day is passed." He therefore advised
that Godoy should be bribed.</p>

<p>The advice came too late. Already the favourite had instructed
Don Domingo d'Yriarte, his envoy to the now extinct Polish
Republic, to confer with Barth&eacute;lemy, the French Ambassador at
Basle. The actions of Yriarte, of course, depended on the secret
behests of Godoy. On 2nd July Godoy informed him that peace
was the only means of thwarting the efforts of the bad counsellors
of the Crown; and four days later he wrote:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>Every day makes peace more necessary. There is no hope of restoring
affairs in Navarre. Cowardice has unnerved our army and the
French will dictate their terms to us.... I fear that their claims will
be excessive, and condescension is our only resource if we are to succeed
in saving ourselves even in part. Your Lordship need not take
alarm at the rigour of the terms of peace; listen to them, accept them,
and forward them to me, saying to yourself that perhaps they will not
be so fatal as the results of a delay in the negotiation might be.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>
</div>


<p>Yriarte, a nervous valetudinarian, eagerly accepted this despicable
advice. Already one of his secretaries had allowed
Barth&eacute;lemy to see an almost equally base effusion from Godoy;
so that the French ambassador on 21st July informed the Committee
of Public Safety that the game was in their hands. This
was the case. Yriarte, after receiving two packets from Madrid,
hastily sought a nocturnal interview with Barth&eacute;lemy by the
help of a dark lantern. The French ambassador received him
with some surprise, especially on hearing that he came to sign
a treaty of peace on terms not yet known at Paris. When the
Spaniard insisted on signing at once, Barth&eacute;lemy examined the
conditions, and finding them highly favourable to France, consulted
his secretaries, with the result that he finally decided to
conclude the affair.</p>

<p>Thus came about the Peace of Basle (22nd July 1795). Spain
now waived her former demands, the restoration of religious
worship in France, and French aid in the recovery of Gibraltar.
The French, however, now agreed to restore all the districts
held by their troops in the North of Spain, while the Court of
Madrid ceded San Domingo. Spain also made peace with the
Dutch or Batavian Republic, and offered to mediate between
France and Portugal, Naples, Sardinia, and Parma.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Such were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>the chief clauses of this astonishing compact. It dealt a deadly
blow to Pitt. For at the very time when he was building up a
formidable league and rousing Brittany against the Republic,
Spain seceded from the monarchist cause, and by surrendering
San Domingo to France, doomed to failure his costly efforts in
Hayti. Further, as will appear in <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">Chapter&nbsp;XI</a>, by setting free
large numbers of the French troops at the Pyrenees, she greatly
enhanced the difficulties of the expedition of General Doyle to
the coast of la Vend&eacute;e. Worst of all, it soon appeared that
Godoy was bent on reviving the policy of the Family Compact,
making common cause even with the murderers of Louis&nbsp;XVI
in order to thwart England's expansion oversea. Bute therefore
warned our Government to prepare to strike a blow at once,
before the Spanish fleet should be ready to help the French either
in Corsica or Hayti. These precautions proved, for the present
at least, to be unnecessary. The degradation of the Court and
populace of Madrid may be measured by the joy with which the
news of that inglorious peace was received. The Queen, fearful
that the failures in the war would lead to the fall of her paramour,
procured the speedy ratification of the Treaty of Basle
and decorated him with the title Prince of the Peace.</p>

<p>On hearing of the defection of Spain, Pitt at once took steps
to guard Hayti against a treacherous attack by detaching the
greater part of the British force then preparing to help the
French Royalists of la Vend&eacute;e. The general opinion both in
London and Madrid was that war must ensue. Godoy kept a
close watch upon Bute, who took a mansion in Madrid on
a long lease in order to lull that Court into security. It was
of the highest importance to avert or delay a rupture with
Spain; for the condition of the British West Indies was most
critical. The French, having recovered Guadeloupe and St.
Lucia, despatched thence emissaries to fire the slaves in the
British islands with the hope of gaining liberty and equality.
The peril became acute in Jamaica. There about 500 negroes
had escaped to the mountains, especially in Trelawny and
Charlestown Counties, and by night carried out murderous raids
against the planters and their dependents. So fiendish were the
atrocities of these Maroons, that the authorities in that island
applied to the Spaniards in Cuba for one hundred bloodhounds
and twenty huntsmen in order to track the Maroons to their
fastnesses. This device proved successful; the murderers were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
by degrees hunted down, and were transported to British North
America, &pound;25,000 being voted by the Jamaica Assembly for
settling them there.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the use of bloodhounds, which placed Britons on
a level with the Spanish crusaders, aroused general disgust.
Attempts were made in the House of Commons by General
Macleod, Sheridan, and Courtenay to represent the Maroons as
men worthily struggling for liberty. Dundas, while pruning
these sprays of rhetoric, declared that Ministers would thereafter
prohibit the use of bloodhounds. These troubles with the
slaves prejudiced Parliament against any change in their condition.
In vain did Francis, in one of the last speeches of an acrid
but not discreditable career, press for the amelioration of their
lot. At the outset he showed the bitterness of his enmity to Pitt
by charging him with the betrayal of the cause which, in his
oration of 2nd April 1792, he had irradiated with the beatific
vision of a regenerated and blissful Africa. Why, he asked, did
not the Minister resign office after his failure to realize his heart's
desire? He then charged him with insincerity on the whole
question, and urged the House to be content with alleviating the
condition of the slaves by giving them the rudiments of education
and some rights of property, above all by securing the
sanctity of their marriages. Fox followed with a speech aimed
more against Pitt than the slave-owners. The Prime Minister
then replied. Ignoring the charges of his opponents, he pointed
out that the proposed improvements were utterly inadequate to
remedy the ills of the negroes so long as Parliament allowed
shiploads of these unhappy creatures to be cast into the West
Indies every year. What was needed, he said, was the abolition
of that hateful traffic, indeed of the whole system of slavery.
For himself, he still hoped that Parliament would adopt those
measures, which alone could be effective. Wilberforce was absent
through illness. Francis, having elicited in the main mere personalities,
not declarations of principle, withdrew his motion.</p>

<p>The lapse of the question of Abolition in the years 1795&ndash;6 was
a public misfortune; for the slaves, despairing of justice from
England, turned to France. For the good of the cause they
murdered men, women, or children, with equal indifference; and,
when hunted down, died with the cry <span lang="fr">Vive la R&eacute;publique</span>. Here
was our chief difficulty in the West Indies. Owing to the
refusal of Parliament to limit the supply of slaves or to alleviate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
their condition, we had to deal with myriads of blacks, exasperated
by their former hardships, hoping everything from France,
and able to support climatic changes which dealt havoc to the
raw English levies. In truth, the success of the West India
expeditions depended on other factors besides military and
medical skill. It turned on political and humanitarian motives
that were scouted at Westminster. The French Jacobins stole
many a march on the English governing classes; and in declaring
the negro to be an equal of the white man they nearly
wrecked Britain's possessions in the West Indies.</p>

<p>For a great negro leader had now appeared. Toussaint
l'Ouverture, though probably not of pure negro blood, was born
at Breda in the north of Hayti in 1746. His mental gifts were
formidable; and when sharpened by education and by long contact
with whites, they enabled him to play upon the elemental
passions of his kindred, to organize them, to lead them to the
fight, to cure their wounds, and to overawe their discontent.
A barbarian in his outbursts of passion, and a European in
organizing power, he became a zealot in the Republican cause.
A quarrel with another masterful negro, Jean Fran&ccedil;ois, forced
him for a time to retire into the Spanish part of San Domingo;
but he soon returned, and proved to be our most formidable
enemy.</p>

<p>The position in Hayti at the close of 1795 was somewhat as
follows. The Republicans and their coloured allies, often helped
by the Spaniards, held or ravaged the greater part of the territory
which the French Royalists had invited us to possess.
Their hopeful forecasts had led Pitt and Dundas to send far
too few troops for what proved to be an increasingly difficult
enterprise; and at this time British authority extended scarcely
beyond the reach of the garrisons. The French Royalists had
not given the help which Malouet and Charmilly had led our
Ministers to expect.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> And on the other hand, Victor Hugues,
the Republican leader, managed to spread revolt in St. Vincent,
Grenada, and Dominica. In this critical state of things, the
Cabinet decided to accord to Major-General Williamson,
Governor of Hayti, a long furlough, and to place in supreme
command a man of great resourcefulness and power of character.</p>

<p>Sir Ralph Abercromby was at this time sixty-one years of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>age; but in zeal and ardour he excelled nearly all the junior
officers. His toughness and energy had invested with dignity
even the disastrous retreat from Holland early in the year. He
was not a great commander; for he lacked both soundness and
firmness of judgement, and he had no grasp of the principles
of strategy; but he restored the discipline and prestige of the
British army; and in him Moore and Wellesley hailed the dawn
of a brighter era. "The best man and the best soldier who has
appeared amongst us this war," was Moore's comment after
Abercromby's glorious death near Alexandria.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Pitt has often
been charged with lack of judgement in selecting commanders.
Let it be remembered, then, that he sent Abercromby to the
post of difficulty and danger.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, delays multiplied at Spithead. Though the
Cabinet withdrew the marrow of the Vendean expedition, yet
not enough troops were available to complete Abercromby's
muster; and when the men were ready, the ordnance and transports
were not at hand. What Department and what officials
were answerable for this scandalous state of things it is hard to
say. Buckingham, who had several correspondents at Portsmouth,
suspected Abercromby of shiftlessness. However that may be,
the autumn wore away amidst recriminations and growing discontent.
When the fleet at last put to sea, it encountered a
terrible storm off Portland; several transports were dashed to
pieces on that point; while others in the van were flung back on
to the Chesil Beach or the shore near Bridport (18th November).
The horrors of the scene were heightened by the brutality of the
coast population, which rushed on the spoil in utter disregard of
the wretches struggling in the waves. The rest of the convoy
put back to Spithead; and not till the spring of 1796 did
Abercromby reach Jamaica. Dundas had instructed him first
to recover St. Lucia and Guadeloupe, whence Victor Hugues had
flung forth the brands of revolt. Ultimately the flames shrivelled
up the colonies of France; but, for the present, they were more
formidable than her fleets and armies. It was therefore sound
policy to strike at those two islands. In a "secret" despatch of
4th November, Dundas also warned Major-General Forbes closely
to watch the Spaniards in San Domingo, and, though not attacking
their posts, yet to support the French Royalists with arms
and money in case they desired to do so.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>
<p>Among those who sailed from Portsmouth early in 1796 was
Colonel (afterwards Sir John) Moore.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> He found the West India
service most unpopular. Yet the energy of Abercromby and
Moore brought about the surrender of that almost impregnable
fortress, Morne Fortun&eacute;e, in St. Lucia. Moore was left as
governor of the island, but with a garrison insufficient to complete
the subjection of the fanatical blacks. General Whyte
found the conquest of the Dutch settlement of Demerara a
far easier task than its retention. Abercromby then relieved St.
Vincent and strengthened the defences of Grenada, that island
having been recaptured by General Nicols. Abercromby and
his comrades thus saved those possessions from the most imminent
danger. His services were almost as great in the quarters
as on the field. He adapted the cumbrous uniform to the needs
of the tropics, and, by abolishing parades and drills in the noontide
heats, and improving the sanitary conditions of the camps,
sought to stay the ravages of disease, of which the carelessness
or stupidity of officials had been the most potent ally. On
21st April 1796 Sheridan moved for a return of the troops
who had succumbed to disease in the West Indies. He asserted
that several of them, on landing, were without shoes and stockings,
that hospitals crowded with sick were without medicines or
bandages, and that in one case a hundred patients had to spend
the night on the bare beach. Dundas's reply was virtually an
admission of the truth of these charges.</p>

<p>The declaration of war by Spain in the autumn of 1796
brought about a new situation. The Republicans and their black
allies regularly took refuge and found their supplies in the central
parts of San Domingo now ceded to France; but when the British
sought to follow and attack them there, they were assured that
it was neutral territory. The British Government warmly protested
against this duplicity. Either the island was Spanish,
or it was French. If the former, then Toussaint and his men had
no right to retreat thither. If the latter, the British could attack
them. In point of fact, plans for the transfer of San Domingo
to France were at that time dragging slowly along at Madrid:
and when the French General, Rom, failed to bend that Court
to his terms, he departed for the island under the convoy of a
Spanish squadron. This incident was typical of the recent policy of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>Madrid. In every possible way it favoured France. Early in
1796 seven French warships underwent extensive repairs in the
royal dockyard at Cadiz. Merry, secretary of legation at Madrid,
further reported numerous seizures of British merchantmen by
French privateers which brought them into Spanish harbours.
Twelve ships were thus brought into Alicante in the winter of
1795&ndash;6; and English merchants could get no redress for these
seizures. French privateers also fitted out at Trinidad to act
against Grenada and Tobago.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>Provocations were not all on one side. Early in 1796, three
Spanish West Indiamen were overhauled by two English frigates
and taken to Bermuda, in the belief that war had broken out.
They were, however, at once released. Godoy protested angrily
against this indignity, and early in March hinted that Spain's
neutrality would cease on the establishment of a French
Government. Two months later Bute found that Spain was
seeking to form a Quadruple Alliance, namely, with France,
Denmark, and Sweden, a scheme which Ehrenthal, the Swedish
envoy, warmly furthered. The news of Bonaparte's victories in
Italy and of the financial troubles in England evidently puffed
up Godoy with the hope of playing the part of an Alberoni
for the humiliation of England; and in 1796 Spain had better
prospects of worsting the islanders than in 1718 when they had
the alliance of France, Austria, and Holland. In truth, no
period was more favourable for a revival of the Latin races
than the years 1796&ndash;7, when England was in dire straits, when
Austria succumbed under the blows of Bonaparte, and the
Dutch, Danes, and Swedes opposed the British Power. With
singleness of purpose and honesty in their administrations,
France, Spain, and their Allies should have wrecked the lifework
of the two Pitts.</p>

<p>The British Ministers felt the gravity of the situation. In
view of the collapse of the Austrian Power in Lombardy, Pitt
wrote to Grenville on 28th June in unusually despondent terms,
that it was hopeless to expect Austria to prolong the war after
the present campaign. We should be left alone to confront
France and Holland, "probably joined by Spain, and perhaps
favoured more or less openly by the Northern Powers."<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Accordingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
we must see to our home defences, and also consider
the possibility of a general peace. Grenville therefore urged
Bute to seek by all methods compatible with his dignity "to
preserve the good understanding of the two countries." In fact,
Pitt and his colleagues now decided to bring about a general
pacification; and, as will appear later, they held to that resolve,
in spite of the strong opposition of George&nbsp;III. But, on 5th
August, while they were discussing details, Bonaparte won a
crushing victory over Wurmser at Castiglione, and, eleven days
later, Godoy definitely sided with France. Pitt feared that the
hostile league would include Denmark and Sweden; and, but
for his foresight in gaining over Catharine, this would have been
the issue of events. Even so, Godoy hoped to form a Quadruple
Alliance with France, Holland, and Prussia. He therefore took
a high tone with Bute, declaring that England would not be
allowed to attack San Domingo, as it was still Spanish, and there
was a necessary connection between France and Spain; but he
would not hear of Bute accepting that statement as a declaration
of war.</p>

<p>Clearly, Spain was trying to gain time; for reports from Cadiz
showed her fleet to be far from ready, several of the ships being
leaky. The repairs to the French ships at that dockyard also
went on in the most leisurely manner. But on 4th August all
was ready. Admiral Mann with a small blockading force having
been called by Jervis into the Mediterranean, the French
ships set sail, escorted by twenty Spanish sail-of-the-line. The
French squadron made for the Bank of Newfoundland and inflicted
great damage. Why it did not proceed along with the
Spaniards to the West Indies is hard to say. The impact of
twenty-seven sail-of-the-line in that quarter would have been decisive;
but probably Godoy did not yet feel warranted in throwing
down the gauntlet. Pitt and Grenville decided to overlook
the gross breach of neutrality at Cadiz, and even now hoped
for a change in Godoy's mood. On 26th August Grenville informed
Bute that, though England had good cause for declaring
war, she would await the result of the recent proposals to Spain.
On or about that date Las Casas, the Spanish ambassador, pettishly
left London on a flimsy pretext; and two days later Dundas
warned the commander-in-chief in Hayti of the imminence
of war. Nevertheless, while taking every precaution, he was not
to attack the Spaniards until definite news of a rupture arrived.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
Further, on the 31st (as will appear in the <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">following chapter</a>)
Portland despatched orders to Sir Gilbert Elliot, Viceroy of
Corsica, to prepare for the immediate evacuation of that island.</p>

<p>It is therefore clear that Pitt and his colleagues used all possible
means to avert war with Spain. Bute, acting on orders
from London, carried complaisance to lengths derogatory, as he
thought, to the honour of Great Britain, and Godoy humoured him
to the top of his bent. Thus, on 10th September, in the course
of a singular interview, Godoy assured him that, even if war broke
forth, it would be brief. If (he continued) England had not annoyed
Spain by her naval and colonial policy, the latter might
have arranged to find some indemnity, either at the expense of
Holland, or else "something on the coast of California. You
English have a passion for California, and the trade is in the
most flourishing state." Half amused by these dilatory tactics,
Bute sought to find out the real state of the case; and he discovered
that the Franco-Spanish compact aimed at the joint
conquest of Portugal as well as of Naples, Sicily, and Gibraltar,
while England was to be compelled to surrender Honduras and
Hayti. On the 5th of October he received from Godoy the
Spanish declaration of war. It laid stress on the disputes at
Toulon, England's seizure of Corsica, Hayti, and Dutch Demerara,
besides the founding of British mercantile posts on the
River Missouri, which evidently aimed at securing the routes to
the Pacific.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Of these schemes, the conquest of Portugal lay the
nearest to the heart of Godoy.</p>

<p>The rupture with Spain is an event of prime importance.
Because her fleet was disastrously beaten by Jervis off Cape
St. Vincent in February 1797, it has too often been assumed
that she counted for little in the war. An examination of the
British Records reveals the error of that assumption. The
evacuation of Corsica and of the Mediterranean by the British
forces resulted solely from the Spanish offensive. Though weak
in herself, Spain held so strong a position in Europe and the
West Indies as to endanger British enterprises at many points,
besides threatening the coasts of Ireland. In truth, but for Spanish
support in the Mediterranean, Bonaparte could never have ventured
upon his Eastern expedition. Thus the defection of the
Court of Madrid changed the character of the war. Thenceforth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>it revolved more and more around colonial questions, to the
weakening of the royalist and republican motives which had
worked so potently in its early stages. The oriental adventure of
the young Corsican was to emphasize the contrast between the
years 1793 and 1798; but the scene-shifting began with the
intrigues of Godoy. In a sense Pitt himself helped on the
transformation. He did not regard the struggle against France
as one of political principle. He aimed solely at curbing the
aggression of the Jacobins upon Holland; and the obvious
device of weakening France by expeditions to the West Indies
further helped to bring events back into the arena of eighteenth-century
strife. Now that Spain, the protagonist of the French
Bourbons, deserted their cause and attacked the Power in which
they most trusted, all pretence of a war of principle vanished.
The importance of the change was not perceived at the time,
though signs of it were not wanting. Both in France and England
democratic enthusiasm speedily died down, and the discontent,
which now and again flared forth in both lands, was but a feeble
sputter compared with the devouring flame of 1789.</p>

<p>In the West Indies the effects of the rupture with Spain
were speedily felt. On 9th September 1796 Dundas instructed
Forbes, commander-in-chief in Hayti, to help the Spanish
settlers if they resisted the transfer of their part of the island
to France. He also enjoined the utmost possible economy in
public expenditure, and urged that the French settlers should
have a large share in the conduct of local affairs. This zeal on
behalf of local self-government was markedly opportunist. It
arose from a suggestion of Colonel Wigglesworth, Commissary-General
in Hayti, that the expenses of that colony would not
lessen until there was a regular Government. In the midst of
the financial strain at home Pitt and his colleagues desired
that the French settlers should bear their share of the expense
of maintaining bands of native auxiliaries. By one of the
unaccountable impulses that sway the negro mind, a considerable
force was now available; but it could not be utilized
owing to the rigid economy enjoined by the Home Government.
As the financial outlook darkened, Portland and Dundas
sent urgent warnings to the new Governor of Hayti, Major-General
Simcoe, bidding him concentrate the whole of the
British force at Cape Nicholas Mole, the probable objective of
the French and Spaniards. The military administration must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
withdrawn to that fortress, the British cavalry being sent home.
Further, as Great Britain could in no case bear a larger financial
burden than &pound;300,000 a year for Hayti, expenses were to be
reduced on all sides, the residue falling to the share of the
colonists. A larger naval force would, however, be sent; and
Simcoe was advised to seize the island of Tortuga and to alarm
the Spaniards by feints against Havannah.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the end at Hayti. Ministers, in
despair of pacifying that racial cauldron, now looked on the
Spanish colonies as an easier prize. Dundas therefore ordered
Abercromby to capture Porto Rico or Trinidad; and he even
dallied with a fantastic scheme for shipping the Haytian colonists
to Porto Rico. Abercromby, however, who again set sail from
Portsmouth in November 1796, decided to make for Trinidad,
and by a brilliant stroke captured its capital, Port of Spain.
The attack on San Juan, in Porto Rico, met with unexpected
difficulties, and ended in failure (February and April 1797). Matters
now became desperate in Hayti. The rebels captured several
posts near Port-au-Prince, largely owing to dissensions among
the defenders. Simcoe, despite a serious illness on his way out,
worked miracles with his skeleton regiments, but both he
and his subordinates failed to cut down expenses as the
Cabinet demanded. Accordingly, on 9th June 1797, Portland
and Dundas reminded him that no further reinforcements could
be sent out, and added this ominous sentence: "It is but too
obvious that&nbsp;... the immense sacrifices this country has made
for the protection of the French part of San Domingo have too
frequently been diverted from purposes of public utility to
answer the worst ends of private peculation and inordinate
cupidity."</p>

<p>In a recent debate in the House of Commons St. John assessed
the expenses of Hayti for January 1797 at &pound;700,000; and stated
that, for the discharge of judicial duties, a Frenchman was
receiving &pound;2,500 a year, which he was now squandering in London.
Pitt remained silent. Dundas did not deny these allegations,
but begged members to recollect the great difficulties of
our officials in Hayti.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> This was undeniable. It is the curse of a
policy of retirement that waverers haste to leave betimes with all
the spoils obtainable. The signs of abandonment of Hayti caused
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>a stampede, demoralizing to all concerned. On 1st January
1798, Portland and Dundas penned the order for the evacuation
of Hayti, owing to the impossibility of making good the loss of
troops or of recruiting in the island. After dwelling on the
impossibility of reducing the expenditure to the requisite
amount, Ministers explained that they had deferred the evacuation
of Hayti "as long as the negotiation which His Majesty
had opened with the enemy at Lille, and the disposition of a
majority in the two Councils of Legislature in France, left a
hope that some immediate arrangement might be made with
that country, which in its consequences might operate to relieve
England from the intolerable burdens by which the British part
of St. Domingo is retained, and to a certain degree to ensure to
its inhabitants a continuance of security and protection....
The rupture of the negotiation and the avowed system of the
present Government of France appear on the one hand to render
the attainment of this desirable end precarious, if not remote,
whilst on the other they impose on H.M.'s confidential servants
an additional obligation of reducing the heavy burdens of a war,
the continuance of which is unavoidable, within the narrowest
limits, in order to be able to persevere in it until adequate
terms of peace can be obtained; and it is certainly their first
and essential duty to appropriate the resources of the country
with such management and economy as may ensure the preservation
and defence of the essential possessions of the Crown...."</p>

<p>The good faith of Pitt in the Lille negotiation appears clearly
in this interesting statement, which further proves that he held
on to Hayti in the hope of ceding it to France on terms satisfactory
to Great Britain and the colonists. Doubtless it was the
perception of this truth which led many of the settlers to decamp
after spoiling the Egyptians. The thankless duty of evacuation
devolved on Brigadier-General Maitland, who carried it out with
skill and patience. Especially admirable is his secret bargain
with Toussaint, whereby that able chief agreed not to molest the
British either in Hayti or in Jamaica, while in return he was to
receive provisions at certain ports under his control. Ministers
had not advised any such proceeding, but they cordially approved
of it, despite the clamour of the West India planters at a
compact with a negro.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> Thus was laid the basis of that good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>understanding which subsequently enabled Toussaint to defy
Bonaparte.</p>

<p>The success attending this agreement shows what power England
might have wielded had not her King, her Princes, and her
Parliament insisted on maintaining intact the institution of
slavery. They thereby aroused an enemy more terrible than
yellow fever, the negro. France profited by the blunder; but she
rushed blindly forward, using the black man with a recklessness
which gave him the mastery. On the other hand, if Pitt and
Wilberforce had succeeded in carrying out their programme in
the years 1790&ndash;2, the incendiary devices of Brissot and Victor
Hugues would have come to nought. In that case the transfer
of Hayti to England would have placed at her disposal myriads
of devoted blacks, ready and able to plant the Union Jack on
every fortress in the West Indies, and to conquer the colonies of
Spain if she changed sides. It was not to be. Far from gaining
an accession of strength in that quarter, England lost heavily in
men and treasure, and at the Peace of Amiens retained only
Trinidad in return for all her sacrifices.</p>

<p>In no part does Pitt's war policy appear to more disadvantage
than in the West Indies. He entered into those expeditions
when the army at home was unable to meet the demands of
the service in Flanders, and on the coasts of Brittany and Provence,
not to speak of the needs of Ireland and the East Indies.
He allowed Dundas to send out levies which were far too raw to
withstand the strain of the tropics. This fact, together with the
stupidity of the regulations and the inexperience, or worse, of
the medical staff, accounts for the waste of life and the barrenness
of these tedious campaigns. At no time had England in
the West Indies a force sufficient to withstand the ravages of
disease and to overcome the Republicans and their black allies.
Nevertheless, while the conduct of the West Indian campaigns is
open to censure, it is difficult to see what other course could have
been adopted towards those important colonies, in view of the resolve
of the French Jacobins to revolutionize them. The attempt
was made and partly succeeded. Could Pitt and his colleagues
stand merely on the defensive, while incendiaries sought to stir up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>a war of colour? Was it not the natural and inevitable step to endeavour
to extirpate those fire-brands? And when so attractive
an offer as that of Hayti was made by the royalist settlers, could
the British Government hold timidly aloof and allow that rich
land to breed revolt? Surely a servile war could be averted only
by intervention at the natural centre of influence. If from Guadeloupe,
after its recapture by the French, the seeds of rebellion
were sown broadcast, would not Hayti have become a volcano
of insurrection? Finally, it is unquestionable that the change of
front of the Court of Madrid in the years 1795&ndash;6 blighted the
whole enterprise at the very time when success seemed attainable.
On Godoy, then, not on Pitt, must rest the responsibility
for the lamentable waste of life in the West Indies and the
ultimate lapse into barbarism of their most fertile island.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="title spaced">THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE: CORSICA: QUIBERON</p>


<p>The French Jacobins early laid stress on the weakness of
the British Empire. An official report issued in January
1793 at Paris advocated a close alliance with Tippoo Sahib, the
Raja of Mysore, and recommended that the French force sent to
assist him should threaten or secure the Dutch possessions at the
Cape of Good Hope, and in Java and Ceylon. "There," it continued,
"you would meet only with men enervated by luxury, soft
beings that would tremble before the soldiers of liberty." The
French conquest of Holland and the capture of the Dutch fleet
in the winter of 1794&ndash;5 brought these schemes within measurable
distance of fulfilment. Failing to save a single Dutch fortress or
warship, Pitt and his colleagues became alarmed about the Dutch
colonies; and when the lethargic Stadholder and his consort
Wilhelmina landed in England, Ministers conferred with him on
this topic.</p>

<p>On 7th February 1795, shortly after his arrival at Kew House,
thenceforth the scene of his debauches, he drew up an order for
the Governor of the Cape of Good Hope, bidding him welcome
the arrival of a friendly British force, which would save Cape Town
from the French. That important post belonged to the Dutch East
India Company, then virtually bankrupt, and altogether unable
to maintain its neutrality amidst the struggles for a world-empire
now entering on a new phase. The officials of the Company at
Amsterdam on 3rd February issued warnings to all Dutch ships
in British ports to set sail forthwith, and further requested the
French Government to secure Dutch vessels from attacks by its
war vessels or privateers.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> A few days later the invaders of
Holland laid hands on British ships and detained even the
packet-boats. In fact, though the Dutch did not frame an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>alliance with France until 16th May, it existed in effect from
the month of February.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> These facts explain the action of the
Prince of Orange, which is otherwise unjustifiable. It was a
natural retort to the conduct of the Dutch authorities. The
British archives also show the alarm of our India Board and of
its president, Dundas. On 5th February he urged the British
East India Company to send in duplicate urgent messages to
India. On 8th and 10th February he inquired whether the extra
troops needed for India could sail on three of their ships now
ready in the Thames; and he requested that some of the Company's
troops stationed at St. Helena should proceed to India,
their place being taken by drafts from home.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>Foremost among Dundas's plans for assuring British supremacy
in India was the acquisition of the Cape. Not that he
valued the Cape and Egypt on their own account. That generation
regarded them merely as half-way-houses to India, witness
the curious statement of Sir Francis Barings, Director of the
East India Company, to Dundas, that the Cape was of no advantage
whatever to us, and might be a dangerous drain upon
our population; but in the hands of France it would most seriously
menace our interests.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> Of how many prosperous British colonies
has not this been said? For similar reasons we took possession
of large parts of India and Canada, not to speak of Malta, portions
of Australia, New Zealand, and the Egyptian Soudan.</p>

<p>Early in March Commodore Blankett set sail from Spithead with
four ships, having on board part of the 78th regiment, besides
marines. The "Sphinx" was to join them at St. Helena. The land
forces were commanded by Major-General Sir James Craig.
Early in April Rear-Admiral Sir Keith Elphinstone sailed with
a larger force, and a further expedition was in preparation under
the command of Major-General Alured Clarke. The Cabinet
expected little or no resistance, and even referred to a friendly
reception as the probable issue. They had some grounds for hope.
The Dutch force at the Cape consisted of about 800 German
mercenaries, whose pay was far in arrears. It was suggested that
we should take them into our pay, and quiet the people by the
promise of abolishing the abuses of the Dutch Company. These
hopes proved excessive. Craig, on making False Bay on 11th
June, soon found Governor Sluysken totally unaffected by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>Stadholder's letter. He was a man "of the most uncommon
<span lang="fr">sangfroid</span>" professing affection to England and dislike of France,
but resolved to keep a firm hold of Cape Town. He offered to
give the squadron all it wanted, and begged for time to consider
the British demand.</p>

<p>Meanwhile mounted burghers poured in from the eastern settlements,
and greatly strengthened the Dutch camp, situated in
a pass half way between the town and False Bay. These
sturdy farmers hoped to win entire independence; for indeed the
Dutch East India Company cramped the life of the settlers at
every turn. Despite the wealth of that land in corn, cotton,
wine, and cattle, it made little progress. The fisheries might
have been productive but for the regulations which forbade the
colonists even a pleasure boat. The Company claimed one-tenth
of the produce of all sales and had the right of pre-emption
and of fixing the prices of goods. Settlers might not even kill
their own cattle for food without the permission of officials.
Cape Town was the only market for foreign commerce, and all
products going in and out were subject to heavy dues.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Far
from thriving on these exclusive rights, that corporation found
its funds crippled by the very regulations which impoverished
and irritated the burghers. In fact the first aim of the Boers
was to trek beyond reach of the arm of the law. Thus came
about the settlement of the remote townships, Swellendam and
Graaf-Reinet, and thus was implanted in that virile race the
resolve to secure complete independence of the enfeebled motherland.</p>

<p>The time seemed to have come when the British force menaced
Cape Town. The Boers, no less than the Governor Sluysken,
regarded the letter of the Prince as a forgery and the whole
affair a mere trick. In vain did Elphinstone and Craig offer
guarantees for good government. The officials and soldiery
were impressed by the offer of enrolment in the British service,
but the armed farmers proved intractable. Not having artillery
or sufficient troops, Craig awaited the arrival of reinforcements
from St. Helena; but on 14th July he landed about 1,600 men
at Simon's Town, and somewhat later began the advance towards
Cape Town. With little difficulty his men drove the
Dutch from a strong position in the Pass of Muysenberg. On
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>the next day the Dutch advanced from Cape Town with all their
force and eight guns, but failed to dislodge Craig, despite his
lack of artillery.</p>

<p>A period of much anxiety ensued, owing to the delay in
the arrival of the reinforcements under Major-General Alured
Clarke, without which an advance on Cape Town was perilous.
The Dutch meanwhile received supplies from interlopers, concerning
whom Elphinstone wrote with nautical emphasis: "The
seas are infested with Americans, Danes, Genoese, Tuscans, etc.,
or in other terms smuggling ships, mostly belonging to Britain
and Bengal, entrenched with oaths and infamy, who trade to
the French islands [Bourbon, etc.] and all the ports in India,
changing their flags as is most convenient to them."<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> He therefore
forbade any of them to touch at the Cape. On the arrival
of Clarke's force Craig took the offensive. About 4,000 strong,
the British pushed on towards Cape Town, amidst a dropping
fire from the mounted burghers, until they drew near to Wynberg.
There the Dutch prepared to offer a stout resistance; but
the diversion caused by three British ships entering Table Bay,
and firing at Cape Town, unsteadied them; and, after little
fighting, they retired towards the capital, crying out that Sluysken
had betrayed them. Early on the morrow he offered to
surrender; and the Union Jack was hoisted on 16th September.</p>

<p>The conquest was delusively easy. The mounted Boers, who
were the heart of the defence, rode off with their arms, vowing
vengeance against the invaders; and some hundred of the
foreign mercenaries, who entered the British service, soon
deserted. On 22nd September Craig wrote that, except the six
principal merchants in Cape Town, all the population was
hostile, and would certainly join the French, if they appeared,
Jacobin ideas being rife alike in town and country. He hoped
that the abolition of "the abominable monopolies" would have
some effect. After Clarke and most of his troops sailed on to
their destination, India, Craig viewed the future with concern,
as Cape Town and the neighbouring bays needed a considerable
force for adequate defence. The population of Cape Town
and district then amounted to 4,957 settlers and their children,
6,068 servants, and 9,049 slaves. In the whole colony there were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>14,929 free settlers, 11,555 servants, and 19,807 slaves. The
oxen numbered 418,817.</p>

<p>The news of the capture of Cape Town caused great relief at
Whitehall. Dundas on 16th January 1796 assured Craig that
His Majesty would have preferred a peaceful acquisition. The
remark does not evince much sagacity; for in that case the
Boers would have represented the occupation as an act of
trickery concocted with the Prince of Orange. As it was, the
Cape was conquered after a fair fight. Undoubtedly in the
month of August the burghers might have beaten Craig had
they been either well led or enterprising. Dundas also instructed
Clarke to leave a strong garrison at Cape Town, and forwarded
news of the capture of Trincomalee, the Dutch stronghold in
Ceylon. The Dutch soon sent a force of 2,000 troops convoyed
by six warships, for the recapture of the Cape; but, while sheltering
in Saldanha Bay, some fifty miles north of Cape Town, it
was surprised by Elphinstone's squadron and capitulated (17th
August 1796). The news of this disaster hastened the surrender
of the burghers of Graaf Reinet who had defied British authority.</p>

<p>In order to mark the permanence of British rule, Pitt decided
to send out as Governor Lord Macartney, who previously had
undertaken a mission to "Louis&nbsp;XVIII" at Verona. His arrival
in May 1797 helped to check the growth of discontent which
was again becoming formidable. Macartney's difficulties were
great. The Dutch held sullenly aloof, in the belief that England
must give up her prize at the peace. Our military and naval
officers disliked Cape Town, owing to the lack of amusements,
the dearness of provisions, and the badness of the roadstead.
Admiral Pringle declared to Lady Anne Barnard that, as a
naval station, it was the worst that the devil could have contrived;
that the people were objectionable, and the animals vile,
even the hens being unable to lay fresh eggs. The soldiers
grumbled at the high prices; for, though beef was only fourpence
a pound, and good wine sixpence a bottle, yet an egg cost threepence
and a dish of cauliflowers eighteenpence. Readers of
Lady Anne's sprightly letters will note in germ the problem
that has beset the British in South Africa.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> They formed a restless
minority among a people curiously unreceptive and suspicious.
They were bored by the surroundings, puzzled by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>Dutch elusiveness, and doubtful as to the future. The war was
going far from well; and the alliance of Spain with France in
the summer of 1796 facilitated attacks from the Canaries and
Monte Video. These difficulties were enhanced by the cold and
tactless behaviour of Macartney.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Pitt resolved at all costs to hold the Cape. Signs
of disgust at the state of affairs in Corsica and the West Indies
early figure in his letters; but as to the retention of Cape Town
he never wavered. Bonaparte's capture of Egypt in 1798 showed
that India was about to be assailed by way of the Red Sea. The
greater, then, was the need to retain the stronghold which dominated
the sea-route to the East Indies. The resolve of Pitt to
assure the communication with India by one or other of the two
routes will concern us later. But we may risk the assertion that
he would certainly have avoided the blunder of the Addington
Ministry in 1802 in giving up the Cape and neglecting to secure
Malta against recapture by Napoleon. Early in the course of
the Napoleonic War, Pitt resolved at all costs to retain Malta
and to re-conquer the Cape. During the negotiations of 1805
with Russia he refused to allow the discussion of our title to
Malta; and in the parleys with Prussia a little later he distinctly
excepted the Cape from the list of the conquered colonies which
Britain might be willing to restore at the general peace.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> Six
days before Pitt expressed this resolve, Nelson won his last
and greatest triumph, thus enabling the Prime Minister to deal
with full effect the blow which won Cape Colony for the British
flag. It is clear, then, that Pitt discerned the enormous importance
of that station as an outwork of India. In fact, after the
expedition of Bonaparte to Egypt and the renewal of his oriental
schemes in 1803, no statesman worthy of the name could fail
to see that either Egypt and Malta, or the Cape of Good Hope,
must belong to the mistress of the East Indies. In the last
resort, then, it was the world-policy of Napoleon which planted
the Union Jack for ever both at Malta and the Cape of Good
Hope.</p>

<hr />

<p>Naval campaigns almost of necessity resolve themselves into
a series of experiments; and after the failure of the attempt to
hold Toulon, a blow at Corsica was the natural sequel. At a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>time when Great Britain had no post within the Mediterranean,
that island was a most desirable prize. Its supplies of naval
stores to the dockyard at Toulon were of the highest value to
the French; and Nelson declared the occupation of Corsica to
be imperatively necessary, as it furnished that dockyard with
the decks, sides, and straight timbers for ships.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> Accordingly,
after the evacuation of Toulon by the Allies in December 1793,
Admiral Hood decided to effect the reduction of the island for
the royalist cause.</p>

<p>Already, while at Toulon, he had received an urgent invitation
from Paoli, the leader of the Royalist, or British, party in Corsica,
to help the islanders in driving out the French. Victor in the
long feud against the Bonapartes, whom he expelled at midsummer,
Paoli now resolved to root out the Jacobins, and his
Anglophil leanings induced him to offer the crown of Corsica
to George&nbsp;III. Both the King and his Ministers received the
offer favourably, Pitt and Grenville regarding Corsica as one of
the indemnities to be exacted from France. Sir Gilbert Elliot,
the King's Commissioner in the Mediterranean, was therefore
charged to administer Corsica. Disputes between Admiral Hood
and General Dundas, the commander of the British troops, somewhat
hampered the sieges of the three French garrisons still
holding out; but by August 1794 Calvi, the last hope of the
French, succumbed to the vigour of the attack of General Stuart,
effectively helped by Nelson, who there lost the sight of his
right eye.</p>

<p>Subsequent events in Corsica, although of great interest, are
not closely connected with the life of Pitt; and I therefore propose
to describe them and the details of the Quiberon expedition
in the volume entitled "Pitt and Napoleon Miscellanies." In
this chapter only the incidents which more particularly concern
Pitt will be noticed.</p>

<p>The attempt to rule that most clannish and suspicious of
Mediterranean peoples first called forth the administrative
powers of Sir Gilbert Elliot, first Earl of Minto. Acting as
Viceroy of Corsica, he sought to promote contentment by promulgating
an excellent constitution and administrative reforms.
But, being hampered from the outset by the factious behaviour
of Paoli, he, with the consent of the Cabinet, deported him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>to England in the autumn of 1795. An equally serious complication
was the feud between the British army and navy.
These disputes, originating at Toulon, grew apace in Corsica.
Elliot sided with Hood, and was therefore detested by Dundas,
his successor, Sir Charles Stuart, and their coadjutor, Colonel
Moore. This brilliant young officer, by nature somewhat a
<span lang="fr">frondeur</span>, was finally guilty of expressions so disrespectful as to
lead to his removal shortly before that of Paoli. He carried his
complaints to Pitt, who bade him set forth his case dispassionately.
Indeed, so impressed was he with Moore's abilities, that
he decided to employ him in the West Indies, and afterwards
advanced him to posts of high importance.</p>

<p>Pitt took little interest in Corsica, leaving it to the intermittent
attentions of Portland. Consequently that interesting experiment
had not a fair chance. The possession of the island
was also nearly useless in a military sense; for the British garrison
could spare no detachments, which, even with the help of the
loyal Corsicans, could effectively harass the French forces campaigning
in the Genoese Riviera. Elliot entered into relations
with the Knights of Malta, and in other ways sought to develop
a Mediterranean policy; but in this he met with scant support
from London. In excuse of Pitt it must be said that he had his
hands more than full elsewhere. Moreover the peace between
France and Spain, framed in July 1795, caused him great concern,
especially as the Court of Madrid manifested deep resentment
at the British occupation of Corsica. In October 1795
Pitt inclined strongly towards peace, and thenceforth carried on
the war mainly with a view to securing indemnities. Corsica
apparently he now looked on as burdensome; for in his speech
of 9th December 1795 he did not include it among the three
valued acquisitions of the war&mdash;Martinique, Cape Nicholas Mole
(in Hayti), and the Cape of Good Hope. Dundas always looked
on the occupation of Corsica as prejudicial to the colonial efforts
which held the first place in his thoughts. Accordingly it was
not utilized in the spring of 1796, when expeditions ought to
have set forth to hamper the march of Bonaparte's ill-equipped
columns along the coast from Nice to Savona.</p>

<p>The opportunity then lost was never to return. Bonaparte's
triumphs in Italy enabled him to prepare at Leghorn to deal a
blow for the recovery of his native island. Checked for the time
by the other claims of the war and the presence of Nelson, he kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
this aim in view; and the conquest of North and Central Italy at
the close of that campaign compromised the safety of the small
British and <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;</span> force in Corsica. The final reason, however,
for the evacuation of the island was neither the menace from
Italy nor the discontent of the islanders, but the alliance of
Spain with France. As Nelson foresaw, that event endangered
the communications with England. Ministers also knew that a
plan was on foot for a French invasion of Ireland, which, as we
shall see, was attempted at the end of the year. They therefore
determined to concentrate their forces for home defence and the
protection of the most important possessions, a decision which
involved the abandonment of the Mediterranean. Accordingly,
on 31st August 1796, Portland sent orders for the evacuation of
Corsica and of Elba. For a few days in the latter half of October
Ministers revoked these orders, and bade Elliot hold firm, their
hope being to tempt the Empress Catharine to active co-operation
against France by the cession of Corsica to her. Whether
that wily potentate saw through this device is doubtful; for she
died on 16th November. Her death put an end to the fleeting
hope of opposing France with an equality of force; for the bent
of her successor, Paul&nbsp;I, was at first towards peace.</p>

<p>Despite the comparative neglect of Mediterranean affairs by
Pitt at this time, they exerted a profound influence upon his
career. In view of the many claims upon the British navy, it
was perhaps impossible to exert upon the coast of Nice and
Genoa the pressure which Elliot desired; but the failure to do
so in the spring of 1796 enabled Bonaparte to win the triumphs
which changed the history of the world. Further, the British
occupation of Corsica, scarcely less than that of Hayti, aroused
keen jealousy at Madrid, and thus helped to set in motion forces
which for the time checkmated England in the Mediterranean.
Not until the Spaniards were beaten by Jervis and Nelson could
she stretch forth her trident over that sea, first from Minorca and
finally from Malta. The loss of Corsica was keenly felt. For,
had England made full use of that island as a base of operations,
Bonaparte could not have carried out his Egyptian expedition
in 1798. Austria also ascribed her overthrow in Venetia and
Styria to the withdrawal of the British fleet from the Mediterranean.
That step seemed a confession of pitiable weakness,
though in reality it enabled the Government to concentrate the
fleet at points more important than Bastia and Ajaccio.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>
<p>Amidst the disasters at the end of the Flemish campaign of
1794 Pitt sought to divert the energies of England to a more
promising field. Thwarted on the Lower Rhine by the vacillations
of the German Powers and the torpor of the Dutch, he
hoped for success among the Royalists of Brittany and la
Vend&eacute;e. He framed this decision reluctantly; for it involved
co-operation with the French princes, the Comte de Provence
and the Comte d'Artois, and with the swarms of fanatical
<span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span> who had long pestered him with mad projects. Further,
he had always been loath to declare for the restoration of the
Bourbons. To do so would be to flaunt the <span lang="fr">fleur-de-lis</span> in the
face of a nation which hated all that pertained to the old r&eacute;gime.
Besides, it implied a surrender to the clique headed by Burke
and Windham, which scoffed at the compromise between monarchy
and democracy embodied in the French constitution
of 1791. Pitt, with his innate moderation and good sense, saw
the folly of these reactionary views and the impossibility of
forcing them upon the French people. Nevertheless, as an experiment
in the course of that bewildering strife, he had recourse
to the <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span>.</p>

<p>The accession of Windham to the Cabinet, in July 1794, had
strengthened their influence at Westminster; and incidents
which occurred in France during the winter of 1794&ndash;5 evinced a
decline of Jacobinical enthusiasm. The sentiment of loyalty,
damped by the chilling personality of Louis&nbsp;XVI and the follies
of his brothers, revived now that the little Louis&nbsp;XVII was being
slowly done to death by his gaolers in the Temple. The rapacity
and vulgar ostentation of the Thermidorian party, then in power,
provoked general disgust; and despair of any satisfactory settlement
began to range friends of order on the side of the monarchy.
The late American envoy at Paris, Gouverneur Morris, informed
Bland Burges at our Foreign Office, on 28th June 1795, that the
state of France was so desperate as to admit of cure only by the
restoration of the old dynasty; that the recent death of Louis&nbsp;XVII
was a benefit to the cause inasmuch as his mind had been completely
brutalized; and finally the envoy heartily wished success
to every effort to overthrow the despicable Government at
Paris.</p>

<p>Though the Royalist leaders in the west of France early in the
year 1795 made a truce with the Republic, yet the resumption of
the civil war in that quarter was known to be only a question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
of time. Windham, therefore, urged the despatch of an expedition
to Brittany. His royalist zeal had now developed his
powers to their utmost. Early in the course of the French Revolution
the chivalry of his nature detached him from the Foxites.
The glow and beauty of his periods marked him out as the
successor of Burke in the House of Commons; yet in no respect
did he attain complete success. His speeches were too refined
and subtle for that audience; and, worse still, his diffidence or
torpor led him often to miss opportunities of effective intervention.
The sensitiveness of his nature appeared in his falling in
love at first sight with a Highland girl whom Burke and he
casually met during a tour. His loss of her made a painful impression
on him.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> The butt of an unkind fate, he seemed
destined also to be the leader of lost causes; and the proud and
penniless <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span> found in him their most devoted friend.</p>

<p>Despite the opposition of Dundas, and the doubts of Pitt, his
views prevailed; and preparations began for an Anglo-French
expedition to the coast of Brittany. During the winter there had
arrived in London a Breton leader of gigantic stature and considerable
mental powers, the Comte de Puisaye. He had fought
devotedly for the constitutional monarchy in that great province
and had the confidence of its inhabitants, whether nobles or
peasants (<i>Chouans</i>). But French princes and the cliques of
"pure" Royalists looked on him, as Marie Antoinette looked on
Mirabeau, merely as a rebel who had partly seen the error of his
ways. Secretly they resolved to make use of him, as he had
gained the confidence of Windham and Pitt, but to throw him
over at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Cabinet began to equip regiments of French
Royalists destined to form the spearhead of the "Royal and
Catholic Army." Various causes delayed the preparations, the
chief being the absence in North Germany of seasoned corps
of <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span> whose presence in Brittany, was essential. Puisaye
therefore urged Ministers to allow him to enrol recruits from
among the French prisoners of war in England&mdash;a dangerous
device which, unfortunately, was adopted. Undoubtedly the
initiative in this matter rested with him; and it is noteworthy
that other royalist leaders had tried the plan, hitherto with
no untoward results.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> Prisoners were not forced into the new
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>corps; but it is clear that some of them enlisted in order
to get back to France. As for the finances of the enterprise,
they were partly met by the manufacture of royalist <span lang="fr">assignats</span>.
Whether they were like the forged <span lang="fr">assignats</span> manufactured, with
the connivance of Government, near Hexham and Durham, is
not clear. It is alleged by royalist writers that they bore a
mark ensuring identification, so that, in case of a monarchist
triumph, they would be duly honoured. The chief aim, however,
certainly was to discredit the republican notes and to embarrass
the Parisian Government. That Pitt should in any way have
countenanced these underhand devices is discreditable.</p>

<p>Owing to the declaration of war by Holland (May 1795), the
vacillations of Spain, and the determination of George&nbsp;III to
keep troops in Hanover,<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> very few British were available for the
enterprise. It is worth noting that the King disliked the <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span>
and often shocked Windham by assertions at Court that they
would prove false. His influence was used steadily against all
attempts in their favour. There were, indeed, good grounds for
suspicion even at this time. Seeing that Charette and other
Breton leaders still observed the truce with the Republic, the
risks of a landing were great; and this explains the reluctance
of the Cabinet to allow the Comte d'Artois to proceed with
the first contingent.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> It was charged to occupy the Quiberon
Peninsula as a base for further exertions, to supply arms to the
Bretons, and thus prepare for a general rising, the effect of which
would be clinched by the arrival of a larger force. The vanguard
set sail from Spithead on 17th June 1795. It consisted of some
3,800 <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span>, under the general command of Puisaye, though by
some mistake in drafting the orders, considerable power was
given to Comte d'Hervilly, the senior officer of the subsidized
regiments. At first all went well. The convoying fleet under
Lord Bridport, after capturing three French sail-of-the-line off
l'Orient, made Quiberon Bay and assisted in the capture of Fort
Penthi&egrave;vre, commanding the narrow isthmus (3rd July).</p>

<p>Disputes now began between Puisaye and Hervilly, the former
desiring to push on boldly, while the latter insisted on remaining
in the peninsula. Time was thus given for the republican
general, Hoche, to collect his forces and make spirited attacks
upon the invaders, who soon fell a prey to schism and discouragement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
The doom of the expedition was decided by
the treacherous surrender of the fort to Hoche's men at the close
of a night attack (21st July). As day dawned the Republicans
drove their foes into the peninsula. Wild scenes of panic ensued.
A storm having compelled the larger British warships to keep
in the offing, Puisaye went off in a boat to beg succour from
Admiral Warren. The defence speedily collapsed. De Sombreuil,
who was left in command near the tip of the tongue of
land, unaccountably surrendered, though a British corvette, the
"Lark," and gunboats were effectively covering his flank. At
the instigation of Tallien, the French Convention disavowed the
promise of its officers at Quiberon to spare the lives of those who
laid down their arms; and 712 Royalists were shot down in cold
blood at Auray and neighbouring places.</p>

<p>The evidence proves that the Pitt Ministry had done its best
for this expedition, which went to pieces owing to the quarrels
of its leaders and the refusal of Charette to stir a finger on behalf
of Puisaye, whom he detested. For the final massacre
Tallien and the French Convention are wholly responsible. Yet
it suited the tactics of the English Opposition to accuse Pitt of
planning the death of the French Royalists. Fox, in one of his
wildest outbreaks, charged Ministers with deliberately sending
noble gentlemen to a massacre. Sheridan, too, declared that,
though British blood had not flowed, yet "British honour had
bled at every pore." These reckless mis-statements have been
refuted by the testimony of La Jaille, Vauban, and Puisaye,
royalist officers who escaped.</p>

<p>Before these horrible events were known in England, Ministers
prepared to succour the vanguard at Quiberon. News that Spain
had made peace with France in a highly suspicious manner
weakened this second effort, it being necessary to safeguard the
British West Indies from a probable attack by the Spaniards.
As no more than four newly raised British regiments could be
spared for the Biscay coast, the Earl of Moira threw up the
command, which General Doyle then accepted. It seems probable
that by 3rd August Pitt doubted the expediency of sending
a second expedition to Brittany or la Vend&eacute;e. Nevertheless,
the Comte d'Artois, who about that time arrived at Spithead
from North Germany with a force of <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span>, desired to make
the venture, relying on Charette, and other royalist chiefs who
had once more aroused the men of the West. The Count also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
cherished the hope that the numerous bands of malcontents in
Paris would overthrow that tottering Government.</p>

<p>Events turned out otherwise. The first plan, that of occupying
Noirmoutier, an island close to the Vend&eacute;an coast, proving impracticable,
Doyle sailed to a smaller island, Yeu, farther out at
sea. There the 5,500 troops, miserably cramped and underfed,
waited until the Comte d'Artois should make good his boast of
throwing himself into a boat, if need be, in order to join his
faithful Charette. It was soon apparent that he preferred to stay
in Yeu with his mistress, Mme. Polastron. In vain did the
Bretons under Puisaye and Vauban, and the Vend&eacute;ans under
Charette, beg him to join them. Meanwhile, amid the early
autumn rains the troops deteriorated, and the royalist rising at
Paris proved a miserable fiasco, some 30,000 National Guards
being scattered by a small force well handled by Bonaparte and
Barras (5th October). Finally, a deputation of Bretons proceeded
to Yeu, and begged Artois to place himself at the head of the
numerous bands of devoted gentlemen and peasants who still
awaited his appearance. All was in vain. <span lang="fr">Je ne veux pas aller
Chouanner</span> (play the Chouan) was his reply (12th November).
On the morrow he informed Vauban that he had received orders
from England to return at once. This assertion was at the time
generally believed to be false; the letters of Grenville to the
Prince prove it to be grossly exaggerated. To the despair and
disgust of his soldiers he departed, and finally sought refuge
from his creditors in Holyrood Castle. The British and French
royalist regiments were withdrawn with much difficulty during
the storms of December 1795. Nearly all the horses had to be
destroyed.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Pitt and Grenville had become disgusted with
the torpor of Artois and the follies of the French Royalists.
In particular the absurd failure at Paris seems to have prompted
the resolve of the Cabinet to withdraw the British troops
from Yeu. Pitt's letters of the latter half of October also evince
a desire to pave the way for some understanding with the
French Directory. As that Government was firmly installed
in power, an opportunity presented itself, for the first time since
the opening of the war, of arranging a lasting peace. These
hopes were to be blighted; but it is certain that Pitt cherished
them; and, doubtless, among the motives operating in favour of
peace the foremost was a feeling of disgust at the poltroonery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
of the French Princes and the incurable factiousness of their
followers, in whom the faculties which command success were
lost amidst vices and perversities sufficient to ruin the best of
causes. Pitt continued to support the Chouans by money and
arms; but, despite the frequent protests of Windham, not a
British soldier was landed on that coast.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p class="title spaced">PITT AS WAR MINISTER (1793&ndash;8)</p>

<p class="quote" lang="fr" style="font-style: normal">Si vous affaiblissez vos moyens en partageant vos forces, si vous rompez
en Italie l'unit&eacute; de la pens&eacute;e militaire, je vous le dis avec douleur, vous

est comme le gouvernement, c'est une affaire de tact.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, <i>Letters
of 14th May 1796</i>.</p>


<p>In estimating the services of Pitt as War Minister during the
first phases of the conflict we must remember that the
ambition of his life was to be a Peace Minister. Amidst the
exhaustion caused by the American War, he deemed it essential
to ensure the continuous growth of savings and investments
which, under favourable conditions, advance at the rate of
Compound Interest. His success in the time of peace 1783&ndash;93,
may be measured by the fact that, despite the waste of war, the
rate of progress was not seriously checked in the years 1793&ndash;6.
A Scotsman, MacRitchie, who travelled through England in 1795<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
was surprised to find the large towns in a most flourishing state;
and it is well known that the exports of cottons largely increased
in the last decade of the century. Seeing that the war became
"a contention of purse," the final triumph of England may be
ascribed to the reserve of strength which Pitt had helped to
assure. He did not live on to witness the issue of the economic
struggle brought about by the Continental System of Napoleon.
But a study of the commercial war of the years 1806&ndash;13 shows
that Pitt's forethought enabled Britain to foil the persistent
efforts of her mightiest enemy.</p>

<p>Military critics will, however, reply that Pitt's economies in
the earlier period so far weakened her army as to lead to the
failures of the Revolutionary War. There is some force in this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>contention. A closer examination, however, will reveal facts that
necessarily weaken it. Firstly, England had never kept up a
large army in time of peace. Dislike of a standing army was
almost inconceivably strong; and it is certain that an attempt
by Pitt to maintain an army in excess of the ordinary peace
establishment would have aroused a powerful opposition. He
therefore concentrated his efforts on the navy; and the maritime
triumphs of the war were due in the last resort to his
fostering care. As for the army, he kept it at its normal strength
until the spring of the year 1792, when he decided to effect some
reductions. In one sense this decision is creditable to him. It
proves that he neither desired nor expected a rupture with
France. In his view the risks of war were past. After his
surrender to the Empress Catharine in 1791 peace seemed
assured. Further, his decision to reduce the British Army was
formed before the declaration of war by France against Austria
(20th April 1792). After the rupture of France with Sardinia
and Prussia it appeared the height of madness for a single disorganized
State to enlarge the circle of its enemies. Consequently,
up to the second week of November 1792, Pitt and
Grenville were fully justified in expecting the duration of peace
for Great Britain. Here, as at many points in the ensuing
struggle, it was the impossible which happened.</p>

<p>Is Pitt to be blamed for effecting economies which led to a
reduction of taxes and an alleviation of the burdens of the
poor? The chief danger of the years 1791, 1792 came not from
the French Jacobins, but from their British sympathizers; and
experience warranted the belief that, with a lightening of the
financial load, the nation would manifest its former loyalty. On
23rd August 1791 Grenville wrote: "Our only danger is at home,
and for averting that danger, peace and economy are our best resources."<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
These considerations are political rather than military.
But it is impossible to separate the two spheres. The strength
of the army depends ultimately on the strength of the nation.</p>

<p>It is also well to remember that systematic preparation for
war was an outcome of that struggle. Conscription was a bequest
of the French Revolution. Planned first by Carnot, it was carried
out by Dubois Cranc&eacute; and others in 1798. But in 1793 the days
of large armies had not dawned. It was usual to maintain
small forces of professional soldiers, together with a more or less
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>inefficient militia. In England methods not unlike those of the
age of Falstaff still held good. War was an adventure, not a
science. In France first it became an intensely national effort.
The Jacobins evoked the popular enthusiasm; the Committee
of Public Safety embodied it in citizen armies; and the science
of Carnot and Napoleon led them to victories which shattered
the old-world systems and baffled the forecasts of Pitt.</p>

<p>Let us briefly survey the conduct of the war by Pitt in its
chief stages up to the year 1798. The first period is from the
declaration of war in February 1793, to the Battle of Fleurus,
near the close of June 1794. At the outset he is alarmed by the
irruption of Dumouriez into Holland, and hastily sends a small
British force under the Duke of York, solely for the defence of
Helvoetsluys and its neighbourhood. It answers its purpose;
the French are held up at the Hollandsdiep, while the Austrians
crush their main force at Neerwinden. Thereupon Coburg claims
the Duke's assistance in driving the Republicans from the
fortresses of French Flanders. Pitt and his colleagues give their
assent, because the enterprise seems easy after the defection of
Dumouriez, and Dunkirk is a tempting prize near to hand, but
mainly owing to their urgent desire that Austria shall find her
indemnity not in Bavaria, but in the French border fortresses.
Thus, for reasons which are political, rather than military, the
Cabinet embarks an insufficient force on what proves to be a
lengthy and hazardous enterprise. Further, while the British
push on, Prussia holds back; so that the Duke of York virtually
takes the place of the Prussian contingent. Unaware of the
duplicity of Berlin, and trusting that the Allies will soon master
the border strongholds, Pitt and Dundas prepare to harry the
coasts of France, and to secure her most valuable colony, Hayti.
These are their chief aims in the war. But, while preparing
maritime expeditions, they also drift into a continental campaign,
from which they find it hard to withdraw.</p>

<p>The efforts put forth at Toulon and in Corsica were the outcome
of the treaties with Austria, Sardinia, and Naples, which
required the appearance of a British fleet off the coasts of France
and Italy. While seeking to strengthen both the Coalition and
the Royalists of Provence, Admiral Hood's force found an unexpected
sphere of action at Toulon. In August 1793 that city
admitted the British troops and a Spanish force a few days later.
Thereupon Pitt claimed the help which he had a right to expect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
from his Allies. Naples and Sardinia sent contingents deficient
in quality or numbers; and the Court of Vienna, after promising
to send 5,000 troops from the Milanese, neglected to do so.
Quarrels and suspicions hampered the defence; but the arrival
of the Austrian contingent would probably have turned the
scale. Owing to the length of time required for despatches from
Toulon to reach London, Pitt and his colleagues did not hear of
the remissness of Austria until 22nd December, that is, five days
after the fall of that stronghold. Had they known it a month
earlier, they could have sent thither the large force, then mustering
in the Solent, which on 26th November set sail for the
West Indies.</p>

<p>This seems an unpardonable diffusion of efforts. But Ministers
must already have regretted their readiness to take up the duties
incumbent on Prussia in Flanders; and doubtless they resolved
not to play the part of the willing horse at Toulon. In the early
days of every league there comes a time when an active Power
must protest against the shifty ways which are the curse of
Coalitions. Besides, Pitt had to keep in view the interests of
Great Britain. These were, firstly, to guard the Low Countries
against French aggression, and, secondly, to gain an indemnity
for the expenses of the war either in the French West Indies, or
in Corsica. The independence of the Low Countries was a
European question. The maritime conquests concerned England
alone. Were Britons to shelve their own interests for a
question of international import? The statesman who does so
will not long hold the reins at Westminster. Besides, no device
for weakening France was deemed more effective than that of
seizing her wealthiest group of colonies. On the other hand,
there was pressing need of armed help for the Royalists of
Brittany; and on this ground we must pronounce the West
India enterprise ill timed. A still worse blunder was the continued
inactivity of Moira's force in the Solent and the Channel
Islands. The reports of an intended French invasion form a
wholly inadequate excuse for his inaction. His troops could
have rendered valuable service either in Brittany, Flanders, or
at Toulon. The riddle of their inaction has never been solved.
Ultimately the blame must rest with Pitt, Dundas, and Lord
Chatham.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1794 Pitt hoped to retrieve the failures of the first campaign
and to wear down the French defence. For this purpose
he liberally subsidized Austria and concluded with Prussia a
treaty which, with better management, might have brought a
second highly efficient army into Flanders. The compacts of
that springtide warranted the hope that 340,000 allied troops
would advance on the north and north-east frontiers of France.
They were not forthcoming; but, even as it was, the Imperialists
and the Duke of York routed the French levies in Flanders and
seemed about to open the way to Paris. Earl Howe's victory,
named "the glorious first of June," ensured supremacy in the
Channel. Brittany and la Vend&eacute;e were again aflame. The
Union Jack replaced the tricolour on the strongholds of Corsica
and in the most fertile parts of the West Indies. In April&ndash;May
1794 the collapse of the Jacobins seemed imminent.</p>

<p>But these early triumphs of the Allies were almost as fatal as
their later disasters. Indeed they were largely the cause of them.
Believing that they had the game in their hands, Prussia and
Austria relaxed their efforts at the very time when France
girded herself for a mightier struggle. Moreover, the emergence
of the Polish Question in an acute phase served once again to
distract the German rivals and to weaken their efforts in the
West. Moreover, the Anglo-Prussian Treaty of May 1794 prescribing
the valley of the Meuse as the sphere of action of the
62,400 Prussians subsidized by England and Holland was so
rigid as to furnish their generals with good excuses for refusing
to march from the Palatinate across the front of the French
columns now pressing forward. The upshot was that England
and the Dutch Republic got nothing in return for their subsidies,
while the Prussians on their side chafed at the insistent demands
from London and The Hague for the exact fulfilment of the
bargain. The situation was annoying for military men; and the
British Government erred in tying them down too stringently
to a flank march, which was fraught with danger after the long
delay of Pitt in ratifying the compact (6th&ndash;23rd May); while
the postponement in the payment of the first subsidies gave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>the Prussians a good excuse for inaction.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> His remonstrance to
the Prussian envoy in London, at the close of September 1794,
was also unwise. For it exceeded the more measured protests
of Grenville, and furnished the Berlin Court with the desired
excuse for recalling its troops from the Rhine. In short, the
campaign of 1794 failed, not so much because the French were
in superior force at the battles of Turcoing and Fleurus, as because
the Allies at no point worked cordially together. The
intrusion of political motives hampered their generals and turned
what ought to have been an overwhelming triumph into a disgracefully
tame retreat.</p>

<p>The disasters at Turcoing and Fleurus open up the second
stage of the war. Realizing more and more the difficulty of
defending Holland and Hanover, Pitt seeks to end that campaign
and to concentrate on colonial enterprises and the war in
Brittany and la Vend&eacute;e. Experience of the utter weakness of
his Administration for purposes of war also leads him to
strengthen it at the time of the union with the Old Whigs.
They demanded that their leader, the Duke of Portland, should
take the Home Office. On Dundas demurring to this, Grenville
generously assented to Pitt's suggestion that he should vacate
the Foreign Office (6th July). Fortunately the Duke declined to
take it; and Pitt resolved to make drastic changes, especially by
curtailing the functions of the Secretary of State for Home
Affairs, and creating a War Ministry of Cabinet rank. Some
change was clearly requisite; for of late Dundas had supervised
internal affairs, including those of Ireland, as well as the conduct
of the war; as Treasurer of the Navy he managed its finances,
and, as President of the India Board, he sought to control the
affairs of that Empire. As for the War Office, it was a petty
office, controlled by a nonentity, Sir Charles Yonge, who was
soon to be transferred to the Mint.</p>

<p>In the haphazard allotment of military business to the Commander-in-Chief,
Amherst, to the head clerk of the War Office,
Yonge, and to the overworked pluralist, Dundas, we discern
the causes of disaster. The war with France being unforeseen,
Pitt had to put up with these quaint arrangements; but the reverses
in Flanders and the incoming of the Portland Whigs
now enabled him to reduce chaos to order. He insisted that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>Secretary of State for Home Affairs should cease to direct the
course of the war, but consented that colonial business should
fall to his lot. On the other hand he greatly enlarged the functions
of the War Office. His will prevailed. On 7th July Portland
agreed to become Home Secretary, while his supporter,
Windham, came into the re-organized War Office as Secretary
at War, Dundas becoming Secretary of State for War and the
Colonies. Despite the obvious need of specializing and strengthening
these Departments, the resistance of Dundas was not easily
overcome. His letter to Pitt on this subject betrays a curious
cloudiness of vision on a subject where clearness is essential:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Wimbledon, <i>July 9, 1794</i>.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>... The idea of a War Minister as a separate Department you must
on recollection be sensible cannot exist in this country. The operations
of war are canvassed and adjusted in the Cabinet, and become the joint
act of His Majesty's servants; and the Sec<sup>y</sup> of State who holds the pen
does no more than transmit their sentiments. I do not mean to say that
there is not at all times in H. M.'s Councils some particular person who
has, and ought to have, a leading and even an overruling ascendency in
the conduct of public affairs; and that ascendency extends to war as it
does to every other subject. Such you are at present as the Minister of
the King. Such your father was as Secretary of State. Such you would
be if you was Secretary of State, and such Mr. Fox would be if he was
Secretary of State and the Duke of Bedford First Lord of the Treasury.
In short it depends, and must ever depend, on other circumstances
than the particular name by which a person is called; and if you was to
have a Secretary of State for the War Department tomorrow, not a
person living would ever look upon him, or any other person but you,
as the War Minister. All modern wars are a contention of purse, and
unless some very peculiar circumstance occurs to direct the lead into
another channel, the Minister of Finance must be the Minister of War.
Your father for obvious reasons was an exception to the rule.</p>

<p>It is impossible for any person to controvert the position I now state;
and therefore, when you talk of a War Minister, you must mean a
person to superintend the detail of the execution of the operations which
are determined upon. But do you think it possible to persuade the
public that such a separate Department can be necessary? Yourself, so
far as a general superintendence is necessary, must take that into your
own hands. If it was in the hands of any other, it would lead to a constant
wrangling between him and the various Executive Boards.</p>
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>
<p>The illogicality of this letter would be amusing if it had not
been so disastrous. Because war depends ultimately on money,
therefore (said Dundas) the Chancellor of the Exchequer ought
to control its operations and act virtually as Secretary of State
for War. Then why not also as First Lord of the Admiralty?
No sooner is the question formulated than we see that Dundas
is confusing two very different things, namely, general financial
control and the administration of military affairs. In fact, Dundas
still clung to the old customs which allotted to the Secretaries of
State wide and often overlapping duties. He did not see the
need of a specialized and authoritative War Office, though the
triumphs achieved by Carnot and the Committee of Public Safety
during the past twelvemonth might have opened his eyes. Fortunately,
Pitt discerned the necessity of strengthening that Department;
and, as we have seen, he made Dundas and Windham
War Ministers, with seats in the Cabinet. Thus from July
1794 military affairs had a chance of adequate treatment in that
body; and Pitt deserves great credit for remodelling the Cabinet
in a way suited to the exigencies of modern warfare.</p>

<p>Why did he not appoint that experienced soldier, the Marquis
Cornwallis, Secretary of State for War? The answer is that he
designed him as successor to the Duke of York in Flanders. As
has already appeared, Pitt framed this resolve in February 1794,
on the return of Cornwallis from India; and, though rebuffed
then, he continued to revolve the matter until the beginning of
the autumn, when the opposition of George&nbsp;III and of Francis
II of Austria prevented the appointment of that experienced
soldier to the supreme command of the Allies. As for the
accession of Windham to the War Department, it seems to have
been merely a device to satisfy the Old Whigs. Probably the
question was not even discussed until 4th July, when the Duke of
Portland first named it to Windham. As it finds no place in the
Pitt-Grenville letters until 7th July, we may infer that Pitt and
Dundas accepted Windham with some reluctance as an ardent
partisan of Burke and the <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span>. Windham now persistently
urged an expedition to Brittany; and the Quiberon and Yeu
enterprises were largely due to him. Pitt and Dundas, after
their experience of the <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span>, had no great hope in these
efforts; and after the defection of Spain they discerned the
increasing need of concentrating their efforts on home defence
and operations which safeguarded British interests in the East<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
and West Indies. To these causes may be ascribed their
decision to withdraw the British force from the island of Yeu.
The indignant letters of Windham to Pitt in 1796&ndash;8 show
that, after the Yeu fiasco and the beginning of the peace negotiations
with France, his advice was slighted. His moanings to
Mrs. Crewe over the degeneracy of the age also tell their tale.
In October 1796 he merely "drags on" at the War Office until
he sees what turn things will take.</p>

<p>Pitt's determination to ensure efficiency in the services appears
from two incidents of the closing weeks of 1794. He deposed
Lord Chatham from the Admiralty in favour of the far more
efficient Lord Spencer; and he removed the Duke of York from
the command in Holland. Another change remains to be noted,
namely, the retirement of the Master General of the Ordnance.
The Duke of Richmond had for some time ceased to attend the
meetings of the Cabinet. During six months Pitt put up with
this peevishness; but on the receipt of alarming news from
Holland, he exerted his authority. On 27th January 1795 he
informed Richmond that his long absence from the Cabinet and
his general aloofness would make his return unpleasant and
"embarrassing to public business. This consideration," he added,
"must decide my opinion&nbsp;... and at this critical time it seems
indispensable to make some such arrangement as shall substitute
some other efficient military aid in so important a Department."<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>
This cutting note produced the desired result. Richmond resigned
and Cornwallis took his place at the Ordnance and in
the Cabinet. No change was more beneficial. During the next
three years the Ministry had the advice of the ablest soldier
of the generation preceding that of Wellington. Unfortunately
the Cornwallis letters are so few that his share in the shaping of
war policy is unknown; but it is clear that he helped Ministers
finally to override the resolve of the King to keep the relic of the
British force for the defence of Hanover.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>To conclude the survey of these changes, we may note that
the Duke of York, after returning from Holland, became Commander-in-Chief
of the British army, a situation in which he
earned general approbation. Thus, when it is asserted that Pitt
altogether lacked his father's power of discerning military talents,
the reply must be that he rendered an incalculable service by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>organizing a competent War Ministry, that he put the right men
in the right place, though at the cost of offending the King, the
Duke of York, a powerful nobleman, and his own brother; and
that he quickly noted the transcendent abilities of Moore even
when under censure for acts of disobedience in Corsica. The
results attained by the elder Pitt were far more brilliant; for he
came to the front at a time when the problems were far less
difficult and illusory than those of the Revolutionary Era; but,
if the very diverse conditions of their times be considered, the
services of Pitt will not suffer by comparison even with those of
his father.</p>

<hr />

<p>The torpor of the Dutch in defending their country and the
refusal of the Duke of Brunswick to organize the defence of
North Germany virtually ended the war on that side. In one
respect the defection of Prussia in April 1795 proved beneficial;
for she undertook to keep the States of North and Central Germany
entirely neutral. Had George&nbsp;III condescended at once
to place his Electorate under her covering wing, the whole British
and subsidized force might have been withdrawn in the spring
of that year. Pride, however, for some time held him back from
that politic but humiliating step. Consequently several battalions
remained in Hanover for so long a time as to weaken the blow
dealt at Paris through Quiberon. This was highly prejudicial to
the Breton movement, which would have found in the troops
detained in Germany the firm nucleus that was so much needed.
Even after the ghastly failure at Quiberon, had the French
<span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;</span> corps arrived at Spithead at the end of July instead of
August, the expedition to the Vend&eacute;an coast might have ended
differently. It is usual to blame Pitt or Dundas for the delay in
those preparations. But George must be held finally responsible.
As to the Quiberon disaster, it has been proved to result
from the hot-headedness of Puisaye, the criminal carelessness
of Hervilly, and the ceaseless schisms of the Royalists.</p>

<p>With the alliance of the Dutch and French Republics in May
1795, and the almost open avowal of the French cause by the
Court of Madrid in July, the war entered upon a third phase.
Thenceforth the colonial motive was paramount at Westminster,
for Pitt and his colleagues questioned the wisdom of holding
Corsica. On the other hand they sought to safeguard India by
seizing the Cape of Good Hope, and to preserve Hayti from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
inroads of the French, to whom Spain handed over her possession,
San Domingo. Unfortunately the greater the prominence
accorded to colonial affairs, the wider grew the breach with Spain,
until in October 1796 the Court of Madrid declared war. Is Pitt
to be blamed for the rupture with Spain? From the standpoint
of Burke and Windham he is open to grave censure. Surveying
the course of events from their royalist minaret, these prophets
ceased not to proclaim the restoration of the Bourbons to be the
sole purpose of the war. Let there be no talk of indemnities.
Be content with crushing Jacobinism and restoring order. Such
was their contention; and much may be said for it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we must remember that at first England
was not a principal in the contest. It was thrust upon her by
the aggressions of the Jacobins, and perforce she played a subordinate
part in continental campaigns, the prizes of which
Austria and Prussia had already marked out. The reproaches
hurled by Burke and Windham were the outcome of ignorance
as to the aims of the powerful Allies, whose co-operation,
illusory though it came to be, was at that time deemed essential
to success. Further, in striking at the French colonies, Pitt
followed the course successfully adopted by England in several
wars. But here again his difficulties were greater than those
of Chatham. Indeed, they were enhanced by the triumphs of
Chatham. Where now could he deal the most telling blow?
Not against Canada; for his father had reft that prize. The
French settlements in the East Indies were of small account. It
was in Hayti, Martinique, and Guadeloupe that French commerce
could be ruined. At them, therefore, he struck. But in
so doing he reopened the old disputes with Spain. In vain
did he seek to avert bickerings by suggesting a friendly
understanding about Hayti. Godoy was determined to bicker.
And, as the war changed its character, the old Latin affinities
helped that adventurer to undermine the monarchical league
and to draw back Spain to the traditional connection with
France.</p>

<p>The Spanish declaration of war in October 1796 opens the
fourth phase of the struggle. Thenceforth England stood on the
defensive in Europe in order to guard and strengthen her
Colonial Empire. She abandoned Corsica and Elba; she withdrew
her fleet from the Mediterranean so that Ireland might be
screened from attack. Pitt's views also underwent a change.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
Foreseeing the collapse of Austria, he sought to assure peace
with France and Spain by conquering enough territory oversea
to counterbalance the triumphs of Bonaparte and Moreau in
Italy and the Rhineland. If he could not restore the Balance of
Power on the Continent, he strove to safeguard British interests
at all essential points. Failing to save Holland from the Jacobins'
grip, he conquered and held the Cape. This was the bent
of his policy during the peace overtures of the year 1796. He
struggled on reluctantly with the war, opposing as inopportune
the motions of Fox, Grey, or Wilberforce for peace, but ever
hoping that France would be compelled by the pressure of bankruptcy
to come to terms and surrender some of her continental
conquests on consideration of recovering her colonies. Wilberforce
heard him declare that he could almost calculate the time when
her resources would be exhausted. On the philanthropist repeating
this at a dinner party, one of his guests, de Lageard,
wittily remarked: "I should like to know who was Chancellor
of the Exchequer to Attila."<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> This remark shore asunder Pitt's
financial arguments and reveals the weak point of his policy.
He conducted the war as if it were a Seven Years' War. It was
a Revolutionary War; and at this very time a greater than
Attila was at hand. Bonaparte was preparing to use the spoils
of Italy for the extension of the arena of strife. Nelson, then
seeking to intercept the supplies of Bonaparte's army in the
Riviera, foresaw the danger and thus graphically summarized it:
"Italy is the gold mine; and if once entered, is without means
of resistance." As by a flash we see in this remark and in that of
de Lageard the miscalculation which was to ruin the life work
of Pitt and almost ruin his country.</p>

<p>Despite the opposition of the King and Grenville to the negotiations
for peace, Pitt held firm; and early in 1796 advances
were made through Wickham, our enterprising envoy in Switzerland.
They were foredoomed to failure; on 26th March the
Directory declared its resolve to listen to no proposals involving
the surrender of any of the lands incorporated in France by the
terms of the constitution of 1795. This implied that she would
retain the Rhine boundary, along with Savoy, Nice, and Avignon.
Grenville received the news with satisfaction, remarking to Wickham
that the Directory had acted clumsily and "in fact played
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>our game better than we could have hoped."<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> The effect on
public opinion was even better when it appeared that France
expected England to surrender her colonial conquests. That
France should gain enormously on land while the British acquisitions
oversea were surrendered, was so monstrous a claim
as to arouse the temper of the nation. Even Fox admitted that
if France retained her conquests in Europe, England must keep
those gained at sea. As Pitt pointed out in his speech of 10th
May 1796, the French demands blighted all hope of peace; and
we must struggle on, "waiting for the return of reason in our
deluded enemy."</p>

<p>Pitt regarded the French conquest of Italy as counterbalanced
by the triumph of Jervis and Nelson at Cape St. Vincent in
February 1797; and he therefore refused to consider the cession
of Gibraltar to Spain. Wholeheartedly he sought for peace in
that year. But it was to be peace with honour. In fact, Great
Britain fared better after 1796 than before. As Allies fell away
or joined the enemy, her real strength began to appear. The
reasons for the paradox are not far to seek. Open enemies are
less dangerous than false friends. Further, the complexities of
the war, resulting from the conflicting aims of the Allies, vanished.
England therefore could act in the way in which Pitt would all
along have preferred her to act, namely, against the enemy's
colonies. In Europe her attitude was defensive; and for a time
in the summer and autumn of 1796 fears of invasion were rife.
Accordingly the Quarter-Master-General, Sir David Dundas,
drew up a scheme of coast defence, especially for the district
between Pegwell Bay and Pevensey Bay; he also devised
measures for "driving" the country in front of the enemy. In
November of that year he recommended the construction of
batteries or entrenchments at Shooter's Hill, Blackheath, on the
hills near Lee, Lewisham, Sydenham, Norwood, Streatham,
Merton, and Wandsworth. The failure of Hoche's attempt at
Bantry Bay and the victory off Cape St. Vincent somewhat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>assuaged these fears; but, owing to the alarming state of Ireland,
England remained on the defensive through the years 1797&ndash;8,
until Bonaparte's Egyptian expedition enabled her to strike a
crushing blow at the chief colonial enterprise of her antagonist.
That adventure, together with the aggressions of France at Rome
and in Switzerland, aroused the anger or fear of Russia, Austria,
and Naples, and thereby led up to the war of the Second
Coalition.</p>

<hr />

<p>Amidst the conflict of aims which distracted the Allies in the
First Coalition, Pitt's foresight was not seldom at fault. But only
those who have weighed the importance of the diplomatic issues
at stake, and have noted their warping influence on military
affairs, have the right to accuse him of blindness and presumption.
The problem before him was of unexampled complexity,
and its solution could be effected only by a succession of experiments.
That he put forth too many efforts at one time may
be granted; and yet in each case, if the details are fully known,
the reasons for making the attempt seem adequate. Did not
Chatham fail in most of the expeditions which he sent against
the coasts of France? Even those who censure Pitt for his blunders
in the war will admit that the inspiring influence of his
personality and patriotism nerved the nation and Parliament for
the struggle. True, the Opposition indulged in petty nagging
and in ingeniously unpatriotic tactics; but they only served to
throw up in bold relief the consistent and courageous conduct
of the Prime Minister. It was an easy task to refute the peevish
efforts of Fox to justify the French Jacobins alike before the war,
throughout its course, and in their rejection of the British overtures
for peace. But in every encounter Pitt won more than a
personal triumph. He proved that the war was forced upon us;
that on our side it was a defensive effort; and that despite the
perverse conduct of Prussia and Spain, England had won notable
gains oversea and might expect an advantageous peace, provided
only that the nation persevered.</p>

<p>One question remains. Why did not Pitt call the nation to
arms? The reasons for his caution are doubtless to be found in
the ingrained conservatism of the English character, and in the
political ferment which marked the years 1794&ndash;5. The mere
proposal to merge Line, Militia, and Volunteers in one national
array would have seemed mere madness. For the populace had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
recently been protesting against the facilities given to the loyal
to arm and drill themselves. It was rumoured that, by way of
retort, the men of Sheffield, Southwark, and Norwich secretly
mustered for practice with pikes. In such circumstances, conscription
might well spell Revolution. Here was the weak place
in Pitt's armour. By parting company with the reformers, he
had embittered no small section of his countrymen. In 1794, as
we have seen, he was considered a reactionary and an oppressor.
He therefore could not appeal to the nation, as Carnot did in
France. Even his Bill of March 1794 for increasing the Militia
by an extension of the old custom of the ballot or the drawing
of lots produced some discontent. A similar proposal, passed a
year earlier by the Dublin Parliament for raising 16,000 additional
Militiamen in Ireland, led to widespread rioting, especially in
Ulster. Not until 1797 did the Scottish Militia Act ensure the
adoption of similar methods by Scotland, though regiments of
Fencibles were raised in the meantime.</p>

<p>The preparations for national defence continued to proceed in
these parochial ways. Pitt's authority at Westminster was at no
time more firmly founded than at the time of the meeting of the
new Parliament in the autumn of 1796. Yet the piecemeal
methods went on as before. He proposed to raise by means of
the ballot a levy of 15,000 men in order to recruit the navy and
the Line regiments; and he further asked for a levy of 60,000
men as a Supplementary Militia, one tenth being embodied by
turns so as not to withdraw from work too many hands at one
time. Nor was this all. For the purpose of strengthening the
irregular cavalry, he proposed that every person who kept ten
horses should be required to furnish one horseman and a horse
for such a corps, and those who owned more than ten horses
were to subscribe a proportionate sum towards its maintenance.
He also required gamekeepers and those who took out licenses
to shoot either to serve on horseback or to find a substitute.
In all he expected to raise 20,000 horsemen by these means.</p>

<p>The attitude of the House was on the whole highly favourable
to these proposals. Fox accused Ministers of raising an invasion
scare in order to compass their own nefarious designs; but Pitt's
first proposals passed without a division; that on the cavalry by
140 votes to 30. Nevertheless, Pitt did nothing towards securing
cohesion in these diverse forces, except by a provision which
obliged Volunteers to enrol in the Supplementary Militia, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
take the oath as such, and to train by turns for twenty days at
a time in any part of the country, instead of training once or
twice a week in their own towns. This must have been beneficial
where it was carried out; but, as the Militia was controlled by
the Home Office, it is doubtful whether enough energy was
thrown into the scheme to ensure success.</p>

<p>These arrangements are miserably inadequate in comparison
with the <span lang="fr">lev&eacute;e en masse</span> of Carnot, which baffled the calculations
of foreign statesmen, flung back the armies of the Coalition, and
opened up the path of glory for Bonaparte. Here the popular
armament did not become in any sense national until after the
renewal of war in 1803. The possibilities open to England, even
in that trying year 1795, were set forth by Major Cartwright
in a suggestive pamphlet&mdash;"The Commonwealth in Danger."
After pointing out that, having been deserted by Prussia and
Spain, we must now depend on ourselves alone, he depicted the
contrast between England and France. The French Republic,
relying on the populace, had more than a million of men under
arms. Great Britain was "a disarmed, defenceless, unprepared
people, scarcely more capable of resisting a torrent of French
invaders than the herds and flocks of Smithfield." How, then,
could the danger be averted? Solely (he replied) by trusting the
people and by reviving the ancient laws which compelled householders
to bear arms. But this implied the concession of the
franchise. Be bold, he said. Make the Kingdom a Commonwealth
and the nation will be saved. He continued in these noteworthy
words: "The enemy is at the gates, and we must be friends or
perish. Adversity is a school of the sublime virtues. Necessity
is an eloquent reconciler of differences.... By saying to Britain&mdash;Be
an armed nation, she secures her defence and seals her freedom.
A million of armed men, supporting the State with their
purse, and defending it with their lives, will know that none
have so great a stake as themselves in the Government....
Arming the people and reforming Parliament are inseparable."</p>

<p>At first sight this seems mere rhetoric, but on reflection it will
appear the path of prudence. By the talisman of trust in the
people France conjured up those armed hosts which overthrew
old Europe. At the stamp of Napoleon's heel a new Europe
arose, wherein the most potent defiance came from the peoples
which drew upon their inmost reserves of strength. That these
consist in men, not in money, is clear from the course of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
struggle against the great Emperor. Spain, Russia, and Prussia
adopted truly national systems of defence, and quickly forged
to the front. Britain and Austria clung to their old systems,
and, thanks to Wellington's genius and Metternich's diplomacy,
they survived. But they did not play the decisive part which
they might have done if George&nbsp;III and Pitt, Francis&nbsp;II and
Thugut, had early determined to trust and arm their peoples.
Unfortunately for England, she underwent no military disaster;
and therefore Pitt was fain to plod along in the old paths and
use the nation's wealth, not its manhood. He organized it
piecemeal, on a class basis, instead of embattling it as a whole.
In the main his failure to realize the possibilities of the situation
arose from his abandonment of those invigorating principles
which nerved him to the achievements of the earlier and better
part of his career. It is conceivable that, had he retained the
idealism of his youth and discovered a British Scharnhorst,
Waterloo might have been fought in 1796 and won solely by
British troops.</p>

<p class="title spaced">DEARTH AND DISCONTENT</p>

<p class="quote">The Waste Land Bill will turn the tide of our affairs and enable us to
bear without difficulty the increased burdens of the war.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sinclair to
Pitt</span>, <i>13th March 1796</i>.</p>


<p>On 29th October 1795 occurred an event unparalleled within
the memory of Englishmen then living. An immense
crowd, filling the Mall, broke into loud hissing and hooting when
George&nbsp;III left Buckingham House in the state carriage to proceed
to Westminster for the opening of Parliament. The tumult
reached its climax as the procession approached the Ordnance
Office, when a small pebble, or marble, or shot from an air-gun,
pierced the carriage window. The King immediately said to
Westmorland, who sat opposite, "That's a shot," and, with the
courage of his family, coolly leaned forward to examine the
round hole in the glass. Similar scenes occurred on his return
to St. James's Palace. The mob pressed forward with an eagerness
which the Guards could scarcely restrain, calling out "Peace,
Peace; Bread, Bread; No Pitt; No Famine." With some difficulty
the gates of the Horse Guards were shut against them.
Opposite Spring Gardens a stone struck the woodwork of the
carriage; and the intrepid monarch alighted at St. James's
amidst a commotion so wild that one of the horses took fright
and flung down a groom, breaking his thigh. Thereafter the
rabble set upon the state carriage, greatly damaging it; and
when George later on proceeded in his private carriage to
Buckingham House, he again ploughed his way through a din
of curses. Pitt kept discreetly in the background, or he would
have been roughly handled.</p>

<p>A loyalist caricature of the period gives an imaginative
version of the incident. In it Pitt figures as the coachman
whipping on the horses of the royal carriage amidst a shower of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
stones, eggs, and cats. The King sits inside absolutely passive,
with large protruding eyes; Lansdowne, Bedford, Whitbread,
and others strive to stop the wheels; Fox and Sheridan, armed
with bludgeons, seek to force open the door; while Norfolk fires
a blunderbuss at the King. The sketch illustrates the fierce
partisanship of the time, which stooped to incredibly coarse
charges. But scarcely less strange was the insinuation of Lansdowne,
immediately after the affair, that Ministers had themselves
planned it in order to alarm the public and perpetuate
their despotic rule. The same insinuation found favour with
Francis Place, a rabid tailor of Holborn, and a prominent
member of the London Corresponding Society, who charged
Pitt with imperilling the life of George&nbsp;III in order to keep
office. "It is a curious circumstance," he wrote, "that Pitt
carried all his obnoxious measures, silenced or kept down his
opponents and raised vast sums of money by means of the
alarms which he and his coadjutors had created. The war was
commenced after an alarm had been created, and it was kept up
by the same means."<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Fox and his followers often uttered similar
taunts.</p>

<p>The insults to the King were but the climax of an agitation
which had previously gone to strange lengths. On 27th October
1795 the London Corresponding Society convened a monster
meeting in the fields near Copenhagen House, Islington, in order
to protest against the war and to press for annual Parliaments
and universal suffrage. A crowd said to number nearly 150,000
persons assembled under the chairmanship of John Binns, and
passed an "Address to the Nation," which concluded as follows:
"If ever the British nation should loudly demand strong and
decisive measures, we boldly answer, 'We have lives and are
ready to devote them either separately or collectively for the
salvation of our country.'" Outwardly the meeting was orderly,
if that epithet can be applied to a monster meeting which
advocated civil war. But probably less than one tenth of the
assemblage heard the resolution. Equally threatening was a
hand-bill circulated in London on the practice of "King-killing."
Place says nothing about this, and ridicules the "Address to the
Nation" as a foolish production, which he had opposed no less
strongly than the convocation of the meeting. This was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>usual attitude of Place. He sought to figure as the apostle of
reasonableness, deprecating all unwise acts and frothy talk on
the part of his associates, but minimizing the follies of British
democrats, which he usually ascribed to the insidious advice of
the emissaries of Pitt.</p>

<p>Let us enlarge our survey. From the Home Office Records
it is clear that dear food and uncertain work had aggravated the
political discontent of the years 1792&ndash;4, until the autumn of 1795
witnessed almost an epidemic of sedition. To take one significant
episode. An inflammatory placard, dated Norwich, 16th
October 1795, was widely circulated. That city, as we have seen,
was a hotbed of Radicalism. There it was that the democratic
clubs sought to federate with the view of forming a National
Convention. One of their members, named Besey, now posted
up the following placard. After stating that the prevailing misery
is due to the present unjust and unnecessary war, the number of
abuses and sinecures, and "the monopoly of farms which disgraces
this country," it continues thus: "The Minister would
gladly instigate you to riot and plunder that he might send against
you those <i>valiant</i> heroes who compose his devoted Volunteer
corps.... This would accelerate his darling object of governing
us by a military aristocracy. The countries which supplied us
with quantities of corn now groan under the iron yoke of the
Tigress of the North or lie desolate from this infernal war. We
send immense stores to the emigrants and the <i>Chouans</i>. Those
rebels, not satisfied with traitorously resisting the constituted
authorities of their country, have desolated the face of it. These
honourable Allies must be fed, as others of the kind are paid, by
us." He then urges them to form popular Societies and demand
redress of grievances. He concludes thus: "You may as well
look for chastity and mercy in the Empress of Russia, honour
and consistency from the King of Prussia, wisdom and plain
dealing from the Emperor of Germany, as a single speck of
virtue from our <strong>Hell-born Minister</strong>."<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>In view of these facts, is it surprising that Ministers decided
to issue a royal proclamation against seditious assemblies and
the circulation of treasonable papers? Sheriffs, magistrates,
and all law-abiding men were charged to apprehend those who
distributed such papers and to help in the suppression of seditious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
meetings (4th November). Six days later Grenville introduced
the Treasonable Practices Bill, while Pitt in the Commons
moved the Seditious Meetings Bill. The Prime Minister
stated that, as soon as the Habeas Corpus Act came again into
operation, the political clubs renewed their propaganda and
brought about the present dangerous situation. In order to
suppress gatherings of a definitely seditious character, he proposed
that, before a meeting of more than fifty persons which
was not convened by the local authorities, notice must be given
by seven householders and sent to the magistrates. The Bill
also required the presence of a magistrate, and invested him with
power to stop any speech, disperse the meeting, and order the
arrest of the speaker. But this was not all. The authorities had
been alarmed by the popularity of Thelwall's racy discourses,
resumed early in 1795, which represented Government as the
source of all the country's ills. Whether his sprightly sallies
were dangerous may be doubted; but Pitt, with characteristic
lack of humour, paid Thelwall the compliment of ordaining that
lecture-halls must be licensed by two magistrates; and a magistrate
might enter at any time. The Bill was passed for three years.</p>

<p>Equally drastic was the Treasonable Practices Bill. Declaring
the planning or levying war within the kingdom to be an act of
substantive treason, it imposed dire penalties on those who devised
evil against the King, who sought to coerce Parliament or
help the invaders. Even those who spoke or wrote against the
constitution came under the penalties for treason and might be
transported for seven years. As Fox indignantly exclaimed, if
he criticized a system which allotted two members to Old Sarum
and none to Manchester, he might be sent to Botany Bay. The
alarm of Pitt at the state of affairs appears in a request which he
and Portland sent to the Duke of York, on 14th November, for
reinforcements of cavalry. They asked him to despatch three
troops of the 1st Dragoon Guards from Romford to Hackney,
replacing the Pembroke Fencible Cavalry, which was utterly
useless; to order up two troops of the Cornish Fencible Cavalry
from Barnet to Hampstead and Highgate; to despatch the 11th
Light Dragoons from Guildford to Ewell or Kingston, and the
1st Fencibles from Reading to Uxbridge. These, along with
the Lancashire Militia at Lewisham and Greenwich, and the
Guards in London, would suffice for the crisis.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>
<p>Such were the conditions under which the debates on the two
Bills proceeded. They turned largely on the connection between
the Islington meeting and the outrage on the King. Canning
stoutly affirmed that connection, which Sheridan and Fox no
less vehemently denied. Wilberforce on this occasion supported
the Government. Pitt showed little zeal in defending his Bill,
promising to safeguard the right of public meeting when
lawfully exercised. The debate in the Lords elicited from the
Bishop of Rochester the significant statement that he did not
know what the great mass of the people had to do with the laws
except to obey them. The Earl of Lauderdale pilloried this
utterance, thereby consoling himself for being in a minority of 5.
In the Commons Fox mustered 22, as against 167 for the
Government (6th November&ndash;14th December 1795). Meanwhile
monster meetings of protest were held on 12th November and
2nd and 7th December, the two last in Marylebone Fields,
which now form the greater portion of Regent's Park. The
orderliness of these vast throngs, comprising perhaps a quarter
of a million of men, affords a strong argument against the two
Acts. Lord Malmesbury much regretted that there was no rioting,
now that all was ready for its repression. After the passing
of those "barbarous bloodthirsty" measures (as Place called
them) the country settled down into a sullen silence. Reformers
limited their assemblies to forty-five members; but even so they
did not escape the close meshes of the law. Binns and Jones,
delegates of the London Corresponding Society who went to
Birmingham, were arrested there; and the Society soon gave up
its propaganda. All but the most resolute members fell away,
and by the end of 1796 it was &pound;185 in debt.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>Undoubtedly these measures mark the nadir of Pitt's political
career. Nevertheless, the coincidence between the London Corresponding
Society's meeting at Islington and the attempted
outrage on George&nbsp;III was suspiciously close in point of time;
and a dangerous feeling prevailed throughout the country. Pitt,
as we shall see, took steps to alleviate the distress which was its
chief cause; but after the insult to the King he could not but take
precautionary measures against sedition. After such an incident,
a Minister who did nothing at all would be held responsible if
the monarch were assassinated. Some coercive measures were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>inevitable; and it is clear that they cowed the more restive spirits.
Among other persons who wrote to Pitt on this topic, Wilson,
formerly his tutor at Burton Pynsent and Cambridge, sent him
a letter from Binfield, in which occur these sentences: "The
Sedition Bills also have had so good an effect. Our farmers can
now go to market without being exposed to the danger of having
republican principles instilled into them while they are dining."
Apparently, then, the loyal efforts of Berkshire magistrates extended
to the interiors of inns. Whether the two Acts were not
needlessly prolonged is open to grave question. Certainly, while
driving the discontent underground, they increased its explosive
force. General David Dundas, in his Report on National Defence
of November 1796, states that at no time were there so many
people disposed to help the invaders. Perhaps we may sum up
by declaring the two Acts a disagreeable but necessary expedient
during the time of alarm, and mischievous when it passed away.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p>The insult to the King was but one symptom of a distemper
widely prevalent. Its causes were manifold. Chief among them
was a feeling of disgust at the many failures of the war. The
defection of Prussia and Spain, the fruitless waste of British
troops in the West Indies, the insane follies of the French
<span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span>, the ghastly scenes at Quiberon, and the tragi-comedy
of Vend&eacute;miaire in the streets of Paris, sufficed to daunt the
stoutest hearts. By the middle of the month of October 1795,
Pitt decided to come to terms with France, if the Directory,
newly installed in power, should found a stable Government and
exhibit peaceful tendencies. His position in this autumn is
pathetic. Reproached by the <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span> for recalling the Comte
d'Artois from Yeu, taunted by Fox for not having sought peace
from the Terrorists, and reviled by the populace as the cause
of the dearth, he held firmly on his way, shelving the <span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span>,
maintaining that this was the first opportunity of gaining a
lasting peace, and adjuring the people to behave manfully in
order the more speedily to win it.</p>

<p>This advice seemed but cold comfort to men and women
whose hardships were severe. Political discontent was greatly
increased by dear food and uncertainty of employment. The
symptoms had long been threatening. At midsummer of the
year 1795 the men of Birmingham assembled in hundreds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>opposite a mill and bakehouse on Snow Hill, crying out: "A
large loaf. Are we to be starved to death?" They were dispersed
by armed force, but not without bloodshed. At that time
insubordination in the troops was met by summary executions
or repression at Horsham, Brighton, and Dumfries. In July a
drunken brawl at Charing Cross led to a riot, in the course of
which the mob smashed Pitt's windows in Downing Street, and
demolished a recruiting station in St. George's Fields, Lambeth.
The country districts were deeply agitated by the shortage of
corn resulting from the bad harvest of 1794. A report from Beaminster
in Dorset stated that for six weeks before the harvest of
1795 no wheat remained; and the poor of that county would
have starved, had not a sum of money been raised sufficient to
buy cargoes of wheat which then reached Plymouth.</p>

<p>The suffering was increased by the extraordinary cold of that
midsummer which destroyed hundreds of newly-shorn sheep and
blighted the corn. Driving storms of rain in August laid the crops.
On heavy land they were utterly spoilt, so that even by October
the poor felt the pinch. From all parts there came the gloomiest
reports. In Oxfordshire there was no old wheat left, and the
insatiable demands from the large towns of the north sent up
prices alarmingly. In November Lord Bateman wrote from
Leominster that the wheat crop was but two thirds of the
average, and, if Government did not import wheat directly, not
through fraudulent contractors, riots must ensue. Reports from
Petworth, East Grinstead, and Battle told of the havoc wrought
by blight and rains. At Plymouth the price of wheat exceeded
all records. Lord Salisbury reported a shortage of one third in
the wheat crop of mid-Hertfordshire. Kensington sent a better
estimate for its corn lands. But the magistrates of Enfield and
Edmonton deemed the outlook so threatening that they urged
Pitt and his colleagues (1) to encourage the free importation of
wheat, (2) to facilitate the enclosure of all common fields and the
conversion of common and waste lands into tillage; (3) to pass
an Act legalizing relief of the poor in every parish by the weekly
distribution of bread and meat at reduced prices in proportion
to the size of the family and of its earnings.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>The protests against the Corn Laws are significant. In 1773
the bounty system of the reign of William&nbsp;III was revised, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>average price of wheat being reckoned at forty-four shillings the
quarter. If it fell below that figure, a bounty of five shillings a
quarter was granted on export, so as to encourage farmers to
give a wide acreage to wheat, in the assurance that in bountiful
seasons they could profitably dispose of their surplus. But when
the price rose to forty-four shillings exportation was forbidden,
and at forty-eight shillings foreign corn was admitted on easy
terms so as to safeguard the consumer; for, as Burke said: "he
who separates the interest of the consumer from the interest of
the grower starves the country." Unfortunately, in 1791, Government
raised the price at which importation was allowed to fifty-four
shillings the quarter. The upward trend of prices may have
called for some change; but it was too drastic. In view of the
increase of the manufacturing townships, Pitt should have
favoured the import of foreign corn, though not in such a way
as unduly to discourage agriculturists. England, in fact, was then
reaching the stage at which she needed foreign corn when nature
withheld her bounties at home, and it is well to remember that
1792 was the last year in which England exported any appreciable
amount of wheat. During the Great War she became an
importing country, and at no time was the crisis worse than in
the winter of 1795&ndash;6. Early in the year 1796 the best wheat sold
at six guineas the quarter, or four times its present price; the
inferior kinds were very dear, and many poor people perished
from want if not from actual starvation. So grave was the crisis
as to evoke a widespread demand for Free Trade in corn. This
feeling pervaded even the rural districts, a report by John Shepherd
of Faversham being specially significant. In the towns
there was an outcry against corn merchants, who were guilty of
forestalling and regrating. Possibly but for these tricks of trade
the supply of home wheat might almost have sufficed.</p>

<p>Pitt seems to have thought so; for he wrote to the Marquis of
Stafford, stating his desire to have powers for compelling exhaustive
returns of the wheat supply to be sent in. On the whole,
however, he deemed such an expedient high-handed and likely
to cause alarm. He therefore decided to call for a special
committee to inquire into the high price of corn, and explained his
reasons to the House of Commons on 3rd November 1795. He
urged the need of modifying the old and nearly obsolete law relating
to the assize of bread, and he suggested the advisability of
mixing wheat with barley, or other corn, which, while lessening the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
price of bread, would not render it unpalatable. As to prohibiting
the distillation of whiskey, he proposed to discontinue that
device after February 1796, so that the revenue might not unduly
suffer. The committee was equally cautious. In presenting its
report eight days later, Ryder moved that the members should
pledge themselves to lessen the consumption of wheat in their
households by one third. These proposals appeared wholly inadequate
to Bankes and Sheridan, who urged that all classes
should be compelled to eat the same kind of bread. Francis,
however, asserted that the poor in his district now refused to eat
any but the best wheaten bread. There was therefore every need
for a law compelling bakers to make bread only two thirds of
wheat. Nevertheless, the House agreed to the proposals of the
committee. Members also bound themselves to forswear pastry,
and by all possible means to endeavour to lessen the consumption
of fine wheaten flour. History does not record how far these
resolves held good, and with what hygienic results. An external
sign of the patriotic mania for economy in wheat was the disuse
of hair-powder, which resulted from the tax now imposed on that
article. Thus Rousseau, Pitt, and Nature are largely responsible
for a change which in its turn hastened the disappearance of wigs.</p>

<p>Pitt and his colleagues sought to check the practice of forestalling.
But, as usually happens in a struggle with human selfishness,
success was doubtful. More fruitful was the expedient
of attracting foreign corn by granting large bounties on imports.
As if this were not enough, British warships sometimes compelled
neutral corn-vessels, bound for France, to put in at our
harbours and sell their cargoes at the high prices then prevailing,
a high-handed practice which prepared the way for the Armed
Neutrality League of 1800. These exceptional expedients seem
to have been due to what Sheffield called "a sure little junto,"&mdash;Pitt,
Ryder, and Jenkinson. He further accused them of taking
the corn trade out of the hands of the merchants and then dropping
State management prematurely. Over against this captious
comment may be placed the undoubted fact that, early in the
year 1796, wheat sold at six guineas the quarter, and by the
month of May was down nearly to normal prices. In that month
Pitt deemed the crisis past; for the King's Speech of 19th May,
at the end of the last session of that Parliament, congratulated
members on the success of their efforts to afford relief to the
people. The harvest of 1796 was more abundant; but confidence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
was not restored until late in the year. As Whitbread pointed
out, the increase of large farms at the expense of the little men
led to the holding back of the new corn. The small farmer perforce
had to sell his corn at once. The wealthy farmer could
bide his time.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>In these years of dearth, when the troubles in Poland restricted
the supply of corn from that natural granary, the
importance of the United States became increasingly obvious.
Pitt had consistently sought to improve the relations with our
kinsmen, and in 1791 sent out the first official envoy, George
Hammond. The disputes resulting from the War of Independence
and those arising out of the British Maritime Code during
the Great War, brought about acute friction; but the good sense
of Pitt, Washington, and John Jay, his special envoy to London,
led to the conclusion of an Anglo-American Treaty (7th
October 1794). Though hotly opposed by the Gallophil party at
Washington, it was finally ratified in September 1796, and thus
postponed for sixteen years the hostilities which had at times
seemed imminent. For the present the United States sent us
an increased quantity of cotton wool, but mere driblets of corn
except in seasons of scarcity. Lancashire benefited from the
enhanced trade, while the British farmer did not yet discern the
approach of times of ruinous competition.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>Agriculture had long been an occupation equally fashionable
and profitable. No part of the career of George&nbsp;III deserves
more commendation than his patronage of high farming. That
he felt keen interest in the subject appears from the letters
which he sent to "The Annals of Agriculture" over the signature
of "Ralph Robinson," one of his shepherds at Windsor. A
present of a ram from the King's fine flock of merinos was a
sign of high favour. Thanks to this encouragement and the
efforts of that prince of agricultural reformers, Arthur Young,
the staple industry of the land was in a highly flourishing condition.
The rise in the price of wheat now stimulated the demand
for the enclosure of waste lands and of the open or common-fields<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
which then adjoined the great majority of English
villages. The reclamation of wastes and fens was an advantage to
all but the very poor, who, as graziers, wood-cutters, or fishermen,
dragged along a life of poverty but independence. Though they
might suffer by the change to tillage, the parish and the nation
at large reaped golden harvests.</p>

<p>The enclosure of common fields was a different matter.
Though on them the traditional rotation of crops was stupid and
the husbandry slipshod, yet the semi-communal tillage of the
three open strips enabled Hodge to jog along in the easy ways
dear to him. In such cases a change to more costly methods
involves hardship to the poor, who cannot, or will not, adopt the
requirements of a more scientific age. Recent research has also
shown that villagers depended mainly on their grazing rights.
Now, a small grazier does not readily become a corn-grower.
Even if he can buy a plough and a team, he lacks the experience
needful for success in corn-growing. Accordingly, the small
yeomen could neither compete with the large farmers nor imitate
their methods. While the few who succeeded became prosperous,
the many sank into poverty. These results may also be
ascribed to the expense and injustice too often attending the
enclosures of this period. Far from striking off at one blow the
fetters of the old system, as happened in France in 1789, English
law required each parish to procure its own Enclosure Act.
Thus, when the parishioners at the village meeting had decided
to enclose the common fields and waste, there occurred a long
and costly delay until the parochial charter was gained.</p>

<p>Then again, the difficult task of re-allotting the wastes and
open fields in proportion to the rights of the lord of the manor,
the tithe-owner, and the parishioners, sometimes furnished an
occasion for downright robbery of the poor. That staunch champion
of high-farming and enclosures, Arthur Young, names many
instances of shameful extortion on the part of landlord and
attorneys. Where the village carried out its enclosure fairly and
cheaply, the benefits were undoubtedly great. The wastes then
became good pasture or tolerable tillage; and the common fields,
previously cut up into small plots, and worked on a wasteful
rotation, soon testified to the magic of individual ownership. A
case in point was Snettisham, near Sandringham, where, as the
result of the new wealth, the population increased by one fifth,
while the poor-rate diminished by one half. Young also declared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
that large parts of Norfolk, owing to judicious enclosures, produced
glorious crops of grain and healthy flocks fed on turnips
and mangolds, where formerly there had been dreary wastes,
miserable stock, and underfed shepherds.</p>

<p>The dearth of the year 1795 brought to the front the question
of a General Enclosure Act, for enabling parishes to adopt this
reform without the expense of separately applying to Parliament.
To devise a measure suitable to the wide diversities of
tenure prevalent in English villages was a difficult task; but it
had been carried out successfully in Scotland by the Act of
1695; and now, a century later, a similar boon was proposed for
England by one of the most enterprising of Scotsmen. Sir
John Sinclair was born in 1754 at Thurso Castle. Inheriting
large estates in the county of Caithness, he determined to enter
political life, and became member for Lostwithiel, in Cornwall.
Differing sharply from Pitt over the Warren Hastings affair, he
adopted the independent line of conduct natural to his tastes,
and during the Regency dispute joined the intermediate party
known as the Armed Neutrality.</p>

<p>Above all he devoted himself to the development of Scottish
agriculture, and began in 1790 a work entitled "A Statistical
Account of Scotland." He also founded a society for improving
the quality of British wool, and in May 1793 he urged the Prime
Minister to incorporate a Board of Agriculture. Young bet that
Pitt would refuse; for, while favouring commerce and manufactures,
he had hitherto done nothing for the plough. He lost
his bet. Pitt gave a conditional offer of support, provided that
the House of Commons approved. The proposal won general
assent, despite the insinuations of Fox and Sheridan that its
purpose was merely to increase the patronage at the disposal of
the Cabinet. Sinclair became president, with Young as secretary.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>
The Englishman complained that Sinclair's habit of playing
with large schemes wasted the scanty funds at their disposal.
But the Board did good work, for instance, in setting on foot
experiments as to the admixture of barley, beans, and rice in the
partly wheaten bread ordained by Parliament in 1795.</p>

<p>With the view of framing a General Enclosure Act, Sinclair
sought to extract from parochial Enclosure Acts a medicine
suitable to the myriad needs and ailments of English rural
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>life. His survey of typical enactments is of high interest. He
summarizes the treatment accorded to the lord of the manor,
the rector or other tithe owner, and the parishioners. Thus, in
the case of three parishes near Hull, namely, Hessle, Anlaby, and
Tranley, the wastes and open fields, comprising 3,640 acres,
were divided by an act of the year 1792 in a way which seems
to have given satisfaction. Commissioners appointed by the
local authorities divided the soil among the lords of the manors,
the tithe-owners, and the parishioners, the landlords retaining
half of their portions in trust for the poor. Other instances, however,
reveal the difficulty of the question of tithes. Young and
Sinclair felt bitterly on this subject, as their recent proposal to
give a detailed description of the lands of every parish in
England was successfully opposed by Dr. Moore, Archbishop
of Canterbury.</p>

<p>Pointing out the need of a General Enclosure Act, Sinclair
claimed that of the 22,107,000 acres of waste in England and
Wales, a large portion could be afforested, while only one million
acres were quite useless&mdash;a very hopeful estimate.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> In
order to investigate this question, a Select Committee was
appointed, comprising among others Lord William Russell,
Ryder, Carew, Coke of Norfolk, Plumer, and Whitbread. The
outcome of its research was the General Enclosure Bill introduced
early in the session of 1796, which elicited the sanguine
prophecy of its author quoted at the <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">head of this chapter</a>.</p>

<p>The measure aroused keen interest. On 15th March the London
Court of Aldermen urged its members to assist in passing some
such measure with a view to increasing the food supply, and
providing work for the poor, as well as for soldiers and sailors
discharged at the peace. The proposals were as follows: The
present method of enclosure would be extended so as to enable
the parties concerned to frame an inexpensive and friendly
agreement. In case of disagreement the Bill would enable the
majority of the parishioners, voting, not by head, but according
to the value of their rights, to decide on the question of
enclosure. But, in order to safeguard the rights of the poor, the
choice of commissioners charged with the duty of re-allotting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>the soil would rest with the majority, reckoned both according
to heads and value. The lord of the manor could not veto
enclosure; but his convenience was specially to be consulted in
the re-apportionment of the land. Sinclair also pointed out to
Pitt that, as tithe-owners were now "much run at," their interests
must be carefully guarded. As for the cottagers, they
would find compensation for the lapse of their fuel rights by the
acquisition of small allotments near to their cottages. The poor
also would not be charged with the expenses of enclosure, and
might raise money on loan to fence the plots awarded to them
in lieu of their share in the waste and the open fields. To insist,
said Sinclair, on four acres being annexed to every cottage was
really harmful. Finally he expressed the hope that, under his
plan, the legal expenses of enclosure would on an average be
&pound;5 per parish as against the present burden of &pound;500.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>Pitt's treatment of the General Enclosure Bill is somewhat
obscure. Again and again Sinclair urged him to greater activity.
In April 1796 he begged him to consult with the judges so as
to meet the objections of tithe-owners. In May he warned
him of the general disappointment that must ensue if no
measure of that kind passed in that session. He asked him
whether the Bill, as now amended by the committee, would not
answer its purpose. Pitt gave no encouraging sign. On the
contrary, he gratified the country gentlemen by opposing a Bill
for the Reform of the Game Laws. The proposer, Curwen,
sought merely to legalize the killing of game started on ground
farmed by the occupier. But the squires took alarm, asserting
that every small farmer could then pursue hares and rabbits from
his ground into their preserves, and that country life, on those
terms, would be intolerable. Pitt took their side, averring that
sport was a relaxation well suited to the higher Orders of State,
but likely to entice farmers away "from more serious and
useful occupations." Much may be forgiven to a Prime Minister
shortly before a General Election, which, in fact, gave to Pitt a
new lease of power.</p>

<p>To Sinclair the election brought defeat and chagrin. He
travelled northward to the Orkneys to seek a seat there, and,
writing from Edinburgh on 6th July, tartly informed Pitt of his
rejection after a journey of nearly a thousand miles. He must
(he adds) either obtain a seat elsewhere, or take no further
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>interest in the Board of Agriculture. If Pitt approves of his
labour at the Board, will he show it in some way? "If, on the
other hand," he continues, "you feel the least hesitation about
giving it support, your candour, I am persuaded, will induce you
to inform me at once, that I may no longer be tempted to
waste so much time and labour in such pursuits.... I still
flatter myself, however, that you will see the object in such a
light that you will give the President of the Board of Agriculture
a seat either in the Upper or the Lower House, that he
may be encouraged to carry on the concerns of that useful
institution with redoubled energy." Pitt's comment on the back
of the letter is suggestive: "That he has lost his election, but
flatters himself that a seat will be given him either in the <em>Lower</em>
or Upper House, or he must decline taking further concern in the
proceedings of the Board of Agriculture." A little later Sinclair
renewed his appeal for a seat either at Midhurst, or in Scotland.
Failing that, he hinted that the President of the Board of Agriculture
ought to be a Peer. Is it surprising that Pitt fulfilled
the suggestion by giving his influence in favour of Lord Somerville,
who displaced Sinclair at the Board in 1798? Loughborough
it was who suggested the change;<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> but Pitt must have
approved it; and thereafter the Board deteriorated.</p>

<p>In truth the thane of Thurso had become a bore. His letters
to Pitt teem with advice on foreign politics and the distillation
of whisky, on new taxes and high farming, on increasing the
silver coinage and checking smuggling, on manning the navy and
raising corps of Fencibles. Wisdom flashing forth in these diverse
forms begets distrust. Sinclair the omniscient correspondent injured
Sinclair the agrarian reformer. Young treated the Prime
Minister with more tact. His letters were fewer, and his help
was practical. A pleasing instance of this was his presence at
Holwood in April 1798, when Pitt was draining the hillside
near his house, so as to preserve it from damp and provide water
for the farm and garden below. Young drew up the scheme, went
down more than once to superintend the boring and trenching,
and then added these words: "I beg you will permit me to give
such attention merely and solely as a mark of gratitude for the
goodness I have already experienced at your hands."<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>
<p>Sinclair, now member for Petersfield, brought his General Enclosure
Bill before Parliament in 1797. In order to meet the objections
of tithe-owners and lawyers, he divided it into two parts,
the former applying to parishes where all the persons concerned
were unanimous, the latter where this was not the case. Even so
the measure met with opposition from the legal profession; and on
13th May he wrote to Pitt expressing deep concern at the opposition
of the Solicitor-General. In July he besought Pitt to make
the Bill a Cabinet measure in order to "prevent either legal or
ecclesiastical prejudices operating against it." Nevertheless Pitt
remained neutral, and the Bill was lost in the Lords, mainly
owing to the opposition of the Lord Chancellor.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> In December
Sinclair announced his intention of bringing in a Bill for the
improvement of waste land; but, he added significantly, "I should
be glad previously to know whether it is your intention to support
that measure or not." Pitt gave no sign, and the proposal did
not come forward.</p>

<p>Pitt's treatment of one of the most important questions of that
time deserves censure. We may grant that the fussiness of
Sinclair told against his proposals. It is also true that the
drafting of a Bill applicable to every English parish was beset
with difficulties, and that enclosures, while adding greatly to the
food supply of the nation, had for the most part told against the
independence of the poorer villagers. But this was largely due
to the expense and chicanery consequent on the passing of
parochial Acts of Parliament; and what objections were there to
facilitating the enclosure of wastes and open fields by parishes
where everyone desired it? In such a case it was the bounden duty
of Parliament to end the law's delays and cheapen the procedure.</p>

<p>That Pitt did little or nothing to avert the hostility of bishops
and lawyers in the Upper House convicts him either of apathy
or of covert opposition. He is largely responsible for the continuance
of the old customs, under which a parish faced the expense
of procuring a separate Act of Parliament only under stress of
severe dearth; and, as a rule, the crisis ended long before the
cumbrous machinery of the law enabled the new lands to come
under the plough. It is, however, possible that he hoped to inaugurate
a system of enclosures of waste lands by a clause which
appeared in his abortive proposals of the year 1797 for the relief
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>of the poor. His Bill on that subject comprised not only very
generous plans of relief, but also the grant of cows to the deserving
poor, the erection of Schools of Industry in every parish
or group of parishes, and facilities for reclaiming waste land.
His treatment of the question of poor relief is too extensive a
subject to admit of adequate description here; but I propose to
return to it and to notice somewhat fully the criticisms of Bentham
and others.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> It must suffice to say that the draft of that
measure bespeaks a keen interest in the welfare of the poor,
and indeed errs on the side of generosity. Abbot, afterwards
Lord Colchester, was asked by Pitt to help in drafting the Poor
Bill; and he pronounced it "as bad in the mode as the principles
were good in substance."<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>After the withdrawal of Pitt's Poor Bill, nothing was done
to facilitate enclosures until the accession of Addington to
power. His General Enclosure Act of the year 1801 afforded
timely relief in the matter of food-supply, a fact which shows
that the difficulties in the way of such a measure were far from
serious. The passing of that Bill, it is true, was helped on by
the terrible dearth of that year, when the average price of wheat
was close on 116 shillings the quarter. But Pitt was content to
meet the almost equally acute crisis of 1795&ndash;6 by temporary
shifts, one of which exasperated the neutral States of the North
and prepared the way for the renewal of the hostile League of
the Baltic.</p>

<p class="quote">Torn as we are by faction, without an army, without money, trusting
entirely to a navy whom we may not be able to pay, and on whose loyalty,
even if we can, no firm reliance is to be placed, how are we to get out of this
cursed war without a Revolution?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cornwallis to Ross</span>, <i>15th December
1797</i>.</p>


<p>The year 1797, which opened with events portending the
overthrow of Austria and the financial collapse of
England, brought a passing gleam of sunshine into the gray life
of Pitt. For some time he had been a frequent visitor at Eden
Farm, Beckenham, the seat of Lord Auckland. It was on the
way to Holwood, and the cheerful society of that large family
afforded a relief from cares of state not to be found in his
bachelor household. His circle of friends, never large, had somewhat
diminished with the wear and tear of politics. His affection
for Wilberforce, perhaps, had not quite regained its former
fervour. As for the vinous society of Dundas, a valuable colleague
but a far from ideal companion, Pitt must in his better moments
have held it cheap. He rarely saw his mother, far away in
Somerset; and probably his relations to his brother had cooled
since he removed him from the Admiralty. In truth, despite his
loving disposition, Pitt was a lonely man.</p>

<p>The voice of rumour, in his case always unfair, charged him
with utter indifference to feminine charms. His niece, Lady
Hester Stanhope, who later on had opportunities of observing
him closely, vehemently denied the charge, declaring that he
was much impressed by beauty in women, and noted the least
defect, whether of feature, demeanour, or dress. She declared
that, on one occasion, while commending her preparations for
the ball-room, he suggested the looping up of one particular fold.
At once she recognized the voice of the expert and hailed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
experiment as an artistic triumph. Hester's recollections, it is
true, belong to the lonely years spent in the Lebanon, when she
indulged in ecstatic or spiteful outbursts; and we therefore
question her statement that Pitt was once so enamoured of a
certain Miss W&mdash;&mdash;, who became Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;s of Devonshire,
as to drink wine out of her shoe. But Hester's remarks are
detailed enough to refute the reports of his unnatural insensibility,
which elicited coarse jests from opponents; and we may
fully trust that severe critic of all Pitt's friends, when, recalling a
special visit to Beckenham Church, she pronounced the Honourable
Eleanor Eden gloriously beautiful.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<span class="caption">The Hon. Eleanor Eden. (From a miniature)</span>
</div>


<p>To this bright vivacious girl of twenty years Pitt's affections
went forth in the winter of 1796&ndash;7;<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> and she reciprocated
them. Every one agrees that Eleanor combined beauty with
good sense, sprightliness with tact. Having had varied experiences
during Auckland's missions to Paris, Madrid, and The
Hague, she had matured far beyond her years. In mental
endowments she would have been a fit companion even to Pitt;
and she possessed a rich store of the social graces in which he
was somewhat deficient. In fact, here was his weak point as a
political leader. He and his colleagues had no <span lang="fr">salon</span> which could
vie with those of the Whig grandees. The accession of Portland
had been a social boon; but Pitt and his intimate followers
exerted little influence on London Society. He and Grenville
were too stiff. Neither Dundas nor Wilberforce moved in the
highest circles. Portland, Spencer, and Windham held somewhat
aloof, and Leeds, Sydney, and others had been alienated. Accordingly,
the news that Pitt was paying marked attentions to
Auckland's eldest daughter caused a flutter of excitement. Her
charm and tact warranted the belief that in the near future the
Prime Minister would dominate the social sphere hardly less
than the political.</p>

<p>Among his friends who knew how warm a heart beat under
that cold exterior, the news inspired the hope that here was the
talisman which would reveal the hidden treasures of his nature.
The stiff form would now unbend; the political leader would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>figure as a genial host; the martinet would become a man.
Assuredly their estimate was correct. Pitt's nature needed more
glow, wider sympathies, a freer expression. A happy marriage
would in any case have widened his outlook and matured his
character. But a union with Eleanor Eden would have supplied
to him the amenities of life. We picture her exerting upon
him an influence not unlike that which Wordsworth believed
that his sister had exerted upon his being:</p>

<p>It was not to be. After toying with this day-dream, Pitt suddenly
broke away to Downing Street. His letter to Auckland,
written there on 20th January 1797, announced the decision
of the Minister in chillingly correct terms. In pathetically halting
and laboured phraseology he implied that he had throughout
observed a correct aloofness. After five long sentences of apology
to the father he proceeded thus:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>Whoever may have the good fortune ever to be united to her is
destined to more than his share of human happiness. Whether, at any
rate, I could have had any ground to hope that such would have been
my lot, I am in no degree entitled to guess. I have to reproach myself
for ever having indulged the idea on my own part as far as I have done,
without asking myself carefully and early enough what were the difficulties
in the way of its being realised. I have suffered myself to overlook
them too long, but having now at length reflected as fully and as
calmly as I am able on every circumstance that ought to come under
my consideration (at least as much for her sake as for my own) I am
compelled to say that I find the obstacles to it decisive and insurmountable.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>
</div>


<p>Auckland had a right to feel the deepest pain at this official
missive. The matter had been discussed in newspapers. Indeed,
a caricaturist ventured to publish a sketch showing Pitt as Adam
conducting Eve to the nuptial bower in the garden of Eden,
while behind it squatted Satan as a toad, leering hatred through
the features of Fox. It is to be hoped that Auckland did not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>know of this indelicate cartoon when he replied to Pitt. That
letter has very properly been destroyed. But we have Pitt's
second letter to Auckland, in which he again assures him how
deeply he is affected by hearing of "the sentiments of another
person, unhappily too nearly interested in the subject in question."
He adds these moving words: "Believe me, I have not
lightly or easily sacrificed my best hopes and earnest wishes to
my conviction and judgment." Auckland's reply of 23rd January
reveals the grief of his wife and daughter. For two or three
days they remained in absolute solitude, and that, too, in a
household remarkable for domestic affection. To Pitt also the
decision was a matter of deep pain and life-long regret. Thenceforth
he trod the path of duty alone. On 7th February the
Archbishop of Canterbury wrote to Auckland (his brother-in-law)
that Pitt lived in seclusion and seemed dreamy. At a
recent Council meeting his face was swollen and unhealthy
looking. Probably this was the time at which Pitt informed
Addington that he must take the helm of State.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>We can only conjecture as to the insuperable obstacles to the
union; but it seems highly probable that they were of a financial
kind. In the Pitt MSS. (No. 196) there is a brief Memorandum
in Pitt's writing, of the year 1797, which must refer to his
yearly expenses, either at Downing Street or at Holwood. It
gives the liquor account of the steward's room as "&pound;300 and
upwards," and states that the other expenses of that room
might be reduced from &pound;600 to &pound;300, those of his own wardrobe
from &pound;600 to &pound;400, and those of the stable from &pound;400 to &pound;300.
These figures do not tally with those of the Downing Street or
Holwood accounts for the latter half of 1797, which will be
stated later; and the loose way in which Pitt estimates his
expenses is highly suggestive. We now know that he was heading
straight for bankruptcy throughout this period; and probably
on looking into his affairs he discovered the fact. It is
also certain that he lent money to his mother. She seems to
have lost on farming experiments at Burton Pynsent; for she
charged her sons to defray her just debts incurred in this manner,
and the Bishop of Lincoln in July 1801 stated that she owed
to Pitt the sum of &pound;5,800 on which she ought to pay interest
but did not. Chatham also borrowed &pound;1,000 from Pitt in August
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>1791, and the fact that he paid not a penny to help to discharge
the debts of his brother in the year 1801 seems to show that he
himself was still in low water.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>Piecing together these fragments of evidence, we may infer
that Pitt's near relations were a source of considerable expense,
and that his own heedlessness had by this time further served
to embarrass him. Therefore, his conduct towards Miss Eden,
which at first sight seems heartless, was probably dictated by
sheer financial need. We may also reject the spiteful statement
in which Lady Hester Stanhope represented Pitt as saying:
"Oh, there was her mother [Lady Auckland],&mdash;such a chatterer!
and then the family intrigues! I can't keep them out of my
house; and for my King's and my country's sake I must remain
a single man." This is mere romancing. Pitt went to the
Aucklands' house, not they to his. As for the remark about
Auckland's intrigues, it clearly refers to the painful days after
1801, when Pitt broke with the household at Beckenham.</p>

<p>There was only one method whereby Pitt could have assured
his marriage with Eleanor Eden, namely, by condescending to
political jobbery. It was beyond the power of Auckland, a comparatively
poor man, burdened with a large family, to grant a
dowry with her unless Pitt awarded to him a lucrative post and
sinecures. Of course any such step was wholly out of the question
for either of them. In fact, Pitt opposed Auckland's promotion,
opened up by the death of Lord Mansfield, President
of the Council, though the public voice acclaimed Auckland as
the successor.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Equally noteworthy is the fact that, early in the
year 1798, Pitt appointed Auckland Postmaster-General, with
an annual stipend of &pound;2,500, but required him to give up his
pension of &pound;2,000 for diplomatic services.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> It is pleasing to
record that their friendship was not overclouded, except for a
brief period.</p>

<p>There, then, we must leave this painful incident, but with
heightened admiration for Pitt. Outwardly his conduct appears
frigid in the extreme. Those, however, who probe the
secrets of that reserved soul see that his renunciation of conjugal
bliss resulted from a scrupulous sense of honour. As to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>the tenderness of his feelings at this time, Addington, who
knew him well, gives striking testimony, averring that in his
disposition there was "very much of the softness and milkiness
of human nature." That was the real Pitt.</p>

<hr />

<p>Finance was the all-absorbing question in that gloomy winter of
1796&ndash;7. The triumphs of Bonaparte in Italy and Hoche's attempt
to invade Ireland sank into insignificance in comparison with the
oncoming shadow of bankruptcy. The causes of this phenomenon
are too technical to receive adequate treatment here. Certainly
the Bank Crisis of February of 1797 was not due to the exhaustion
of the nation; for the revenue testified to its abounding
vitality. The Permanent Taxes maintained nearly the high level
reached in the prosperous year of peace, 1792, and the figures for
British Imports and Exports told the same tale, but the sums of
money borrowed in the years 1796, 1797 undoubtedly strained the
national credit.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> Austria also applied to England for loans to
enable her to continue the war; and Pitt helped her to borrow in
London the sum of &pound;4,600,000 in 1795, and &pound;4,620,000 in 1796.</p>

<p>In one particular Pitt's action was unprecedented. In July
1796, during the interval between the seventeenth and eighteenth
Parliaments of Great Britain, Austria sent urgent requests for
pecuniary help so as to stay the triumphs of the French in Italy
and Swabia. Pitt yielded and secretly remitted the sum of
&pound;1,200,000 as a loan. Undoubtedly this opportune help enabled
Austria to make the surprising efforts which flung back the
French to the Rhine, and checked the triumphal progress of
Bonaparte. Nevertheless, Fox threatened his rival with impeachment
for this unconstitutional action. Pitt replied with irresistible
cogency that the crisis called for bold handling, and that
England helped her ally to save the Empire and to maintain
the contest in Italy. The House condoned his action by 285
votes to 81, a proof that he dominated the new Parliament as
completely as its predecessor. He has been accused of lavishing
money on the Allies; but, except in this instance, he did
not by any means satisfy their claims. Moreover, they were
justified in expecting England to provide money in lieu of the
troops which her War Office failed to raise. Austria also solemnly
covenanted to repay the loans; and her neglect to do so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>occasioned a bitter dispute which long held the two Powers
apart. Pitt also refused her request for a loan in the year 1797.
As far as possible, he discouraged the raising of war loans in
London. Early in 1796 he did so in the case of Portugal from a
fear that the export of bullion would impair credit.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>At that time a novel expedient was shaping itself in his mind.
On New Year's Day he drove Sir John Sinclair from Dundas's
house at Wimbledon up to town; and on the way the baronet
suggested the raising a great loan on easy terms by an appeal
to the loyalty of Britons.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> The need of some such device became
increasingly apparent; for sinister symptoms began to appear
amidst the alarms of the autumn of 1796. The threats of
invasion led the Ministry to propose a special levy of 15,000 men
to reinforce the army, of 20,000 irregular cavalry, and of 60,000
supplemental Militia (18th October). These expenses, in addition
to the ever growing demands for the public services, involved a
deficit of &pound;18,000,000. It was most important to raise this sum
promptly in order to uphold the credit and display the loyalty
of the nation; for, as we shall see, Pitt had recently opened
negotiations for peace at Paris in the hope that the late successes
of the Austrians both in Italy and the Rhineland (which
proved to be only temporary), would induce the Directory to
accord fair terms to enemies who thus evinced their energy and
vitality. After consultation with the officials of the Bank of
England, he decided to raise the required sums, not by means
of "contractors," but by appealing direct to the public. Accordingly,
on 1st December, he adopted the unusual course of
appealing to the Lord Mayor and the Directors of the Bank
of England to encourage in every possible way the raising of an
extraordinary loan of &pound;18,000,000. The rate of interest, 5&nbsp;5/8 per
cent., seems somewhat high in the case of a "Loyalty Loan,"
especially as Consols rose from 53&nbsp;3/4 in September to 57 in
November; but competent authorities agree that it was not too
high.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>The response was most gratifying. The Bank subscribed
&pound;1,000,000, the Directors in their private capacity further contributing
&pound;400,000. Similar feelings were displayed in the City
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>and in the provinces. Before the hour of 10 a.m. on 5th December,
when the subscription list was opened at the Bank, the
lobby of the hall and even the approaches were crowded with
eager patriots, who fought their way towards the books. Those
in the rear called to more fortunate friends in the front to inscribe
their names. Within an hour and twenty minutes the
amount which could then be allotted was made good, and hundreds
retired disappointed. Similar scenes ensued on the two
following days, the whole sum of &pound;18,000,000 being subscribed
in less than fifteen and a half hours.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>It was under these encouraging conditions that on 7th December
1796 Pitt made his Budget Statement, which included
the proposal of further advances of &pound;3,000,000 to our Allies.
As a set-off to this, he pointed to the yield of the taxes and the
Imports and Exports for the quarter as affording gratifying
proof of the strength of the country. But, he added, "this
flourishing state of our affairs ought not to lessen our moderation
or abate our desire for peace." Those who blame him
for continuing to pay &pound;200,000 into the Sinking Fund, while
he had to borrow large sums at a ruinous rate of interest, should
remember that he believed this costly device to be only temporary
in view of his efforts for peace.</p>

<p>The usually dull details of finance are at this point enlivened
by the ingenious suggestions poured in upon Pitt for opening up
new sources of revenue. The aim of financiers then being to
press on the taxpayer at all points with the imperceptible impartiality
of air, the hints as to the taxation of neighbours and
rivals are of refreshing variety. Among the less obvious are
duties on barges, pawnbrokers' takings, toys, theatre and concert
tickets, buttons, corks, glass bottles, umbrellas, sheriffs and
under-sheriffs, county commissioners and attorneys who keep
clerks. On behalf of the last suggestion an anonymous writer
points out that it would enhance the dignity of the legal profession.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
Another correspondent suggests a similar impost on
physicians, surgeons, and chemists, ranging from ten guineas in
London to three guineas in the provinces, in order to discourage
the entry of illiterates. He also urges the need of stopping the
increase of luxury and amusements by taxing hot-houses, horses
and carriages let out on Sundays, organs, pianos, and all musical
instruments, as well as the owners thereof, on the ground that
this step will lessen the alarming growth of bankruptcies and
divorces. A tax on armorial bearings is suggested as one which
will not be resented by the rich. A fourth correspondent advocates
a graduated Income Tax, ranging from 6<i>d.</i> in the pound
on incomes under &pound;400, up to 5<i>s.</i> in the pound on incomes of
more than, &pound;30,000 a year, and estimates the total yield at
&pound;62,625,000. The same writer urges the need of a tax on
sinecures and pensions, and finally begs Pitt for a place for
life, devolving on his son.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer therefore had the choice of
the direct attack on the purse or the increase of atmospheric
pressure. For the present he chose the latter method, enhancing
the duties on tea, wines, sugar, spirits, game licences, glass,
tobacco, and snuff, besides raising the "Assessed Taxes" by
ten per cent. The produce of some of these imposts is curious.
Hair-powder yielded &pound;197,000; the extra tea and wine duties
&pound;186,000 and &pound;923,000, severally; those on tobacco and snuff
only &pound;40,000. Pitt's procedure in December 1796 was very
cautious. He carefully watched the yield of the new taxes, in
order to see whether the increase of price checked consumption.
Finding that this did not happen in the case of tea and spirits,
he further raised the duties on those commodities; but, on
behalf of the poor, he exempted the cheaper kinds of tea. On
the other hand he proposed to check the consumption of spirits
by imposing an extra duty of five pence a gallon along with a
surcharge on distillery licences. Further, as the duties on bricks,
auction sales, sugar, bar iron, oil, wines, and coal had not lessened
consumption, he again increased them. A questionable
experiment was an increase in the postage of letters and parcels,
and in the duties on newspapers, stage coaches, and canal tolls.
A new House Duty, levied in proportion to the number of
servants, is open to less objection. On the whole he expected
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>the new taxes to yield &pound;2,138,000. The total supply asked for
was &pound;27,640,000.</p>

<p>The financial outlook grew darker in the year 1797. At the
close of January came the news of Hoche's expedition to Bantry
Bay, which revealed the possibility of revolutionizing Ireland.
On 4th February Pitt heard of the triumph of Bonaparte at
Rivoli. The tidings told disastrously on markets already in a
nervous state. A correspondent of Pitt attributed the decline to
the action of the Bank of England at the close of 1795, in
reducing their discounts. Fox and his friends ascribed it to the
export of specie to Vienna; while Ministers and their friends
gave out that it resulted from the fears of invasion, and the
desire of depositors everywhere to withdraw their money and
place it in hiding. Privately, however, Pitt confessed to Auckland
that the export of gold brought matters to a climax.</p>

<p>The amount of specie in the Bank of England, which was
nearly &pound;8,000,000 in 1795, fell to &pound;1,272,000 in February 1797.
In reality the Bank was solvent, but it could not have realized
its securities; and on several occasions the Directors warned
Pitt that any further withdrawals of specie would bring on a
crisis.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> The final cause of alarm was a loan of &pound;1,500,000 to
the Irish Government, the first occasion on which any large sum
was raised for that Administration.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> On 25th and 26th February,
then, crowds rushed to withdraw money from the Bank into
which eleven weeks before they thronged in order to procure
shares in the Loyalty Loan. So serious was the crisis that
Ministers decided to intervene. On Sunday the 26th a meeting
was held of the Privy Council, which issued an Order in Council
empowering the Directors to refuse payments in cash until Parliament
gave further orders on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>
<p>For a few hours there was the prospect of a general collapse;
and as the Bank issued no notes for less than &pound;5, though Sinclair
and others had advised the issue of &pound;3 and &pound;2 notes, small
traders were threatened with a recurrence to barter. Fortunately
on 27th February the Directors published a reassuring statement,
and the Lord Mayor presided at an influential meeting on
the same day, which decided to accept banknotes as legal tender
for any amount. Thus a crash was averted. But Fox, Sheridan,
and the Opposition ably accused Pitt of leading his own country to
the brink of bankruptcy, even while he proclaimed the imminent
insolvency of France. They thundered against the export of
gold to the Emperor, and demanded a searching inquiry into the
high-handed dealings of the Minister with the Bank and with
national finance. "We have too long had a confiding House of
Commons," exclaimed Fox; "I want now an inquiring House
of Commons." Despite Pitt's poor defence of his loans to the
Emperor, the Government carried the day by 244 votes to 86
(28th February); but the unwonted size of the minority was a
sharp warning to curtail loans and subsidies. Apart from a
small loan to Portugal in 1798, nothing of note was done to
help Continental States until Russia demanded pecuniary aid
for the War of the Second Coalition. In order to provide a
circulating medium, the Bank was empowered to issue notes for
&pound;2 and &pound;1, and to refuse cash payments for sums exceeding &pound;1
(March to May 1797).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, shortly after the Bank crisis, came news of the
failure of an American, Colonel Tate, with some 1,400 French
gaol-birds, to make a raid at Fishguard in Pembrokeshire. A
later legend sought to embellish this very tame affair by ascribing
his failure to the apparition on the hills of Welsh women in
high hats and scarlet cloaks, whom the invaders took for regulars.
Unfortunately for lovers of the picturesque, the apparition occurs
only in much later accounts.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> Far more important were the
tidings from Cape St. Vincent. There Jervis, with only fifteen
ships, boldly attacked twenty-seven Spaniards while still in confusion
after a foggy night. As is well known, the boldness of
Nelson, in wearing out of the line so as to prevent the reunion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>of the enemy's ships, crowned the day with glory (14th February).
The weakness of the Spanish navy stood glaringly revealed, and
the fear of invasion, which turned mainly on a junction of their
fleet to that of France, thenceforth subsided.</p>

<p>Jervis remarked before the fight that England never stood in
more need of a victory. The news reached London most opportunely
on 3rd March; for, along with the Bank crisis, came
rumours of serious discontent among our seamen. Even Jervis
could scarcely stamp out disaffection in the fleet that rode
triumphantly before Cadiz; and in home waters mutiny soon
ran riot. Is it surprising that sailors mutinied? In large part
they were pressed men. Violence swept the crews together, and
terror alone kept them together. The rules of the service prescribed
flogging for minor offences, hanging for refusal to work.
How men existed in the over-crowded decks is a mystery. On
paper the rations seem adequate, a pound of meat per day, a
proportionate amount of biscuit, and half a pint of rum. But
these provisions were issued by pursers who often eked out
their scanty pay by defrauding the crew. Weevilly biscuits and
meat of briny antiquity were therefore the rule, excess of salt
and close packing being deemed adequate safeguards against
decay. Finally the indurated mass became so susceptible of
polish as in the last resort to provide the purser with a supply
of snuff-boxes. One little comfort was allowed, namely, cocoa
for breakfast. But the chief solace was rum, cheap, new, and
fiery, from the West Indies. This and the rope-end formed the
<span lang="la">nexus</span> of the crew. As for the pay, from which alone the sailor
could make his lot bearable, it had not been increased since the
reign of Charles&nbsp;II. Thanks to the Duke of York, that of the
army had been raised from 8&nbsp;1/4<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> a day, though not in proportion
to the cost of living, the net gain being only 2<i>d.</i> a day.
The sailor alone was forgotten, and, lest he should come into
touch with Radical clubs, leave of absence was rarely if ever
accorded.</p>

<p>The men of the Channel Fleet were the first to resolve to end
their chief grievances, namely, insufficient pay, withdrawal of
leave of absence, and the unfair distribution of prize money.
On putting back to Spithead in March 1797, they sent to
Admiral Howe several round-robins demanding an increase of
pay. He was then ill at Bath, and, deeming them the outcome
of a single knot of malcontents, ignored them. This angered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
the men. His successor in command, Lord Bridport (brother of
Sir Alexander Hood), was less popular; and when it transpired that
the fleet would soon set sail, the men resolved to show their
power. Accordingly, on 15th April, on the hoisting of the
signal to weigh anchor, the crew of the flag-ship, the "Queen
Charlotte," manned her shrouds and gave three cheers. The
others followed her example, and not an anchor was weighed.
On the next day (Easter Sunday) the men formed a central
committee, sent ashore some hated officers, and formulated the
demands outlined above, promising to fight the French if they
put to sea, and afterwards to renew the same demands.</p>

<p>That Easter was a time of dismay in London. Ministers at
once met in Cabinet Council and agreed to despatch to Portsmouth
Spencer, first Lord of the Admiralty, along with Admiral
Young, and others. Spencer's reputation for sincerity, love of
justice, and regard for the seamen inspired general confidence;
and when the Commissioners were joined by Bridport, Parker,
Colpoys, and Gardner, there was hope of a compromise. The
men allowed Bridport to retain his command, provided that he
did not issue orders for sea; they enforced respect to officers;
they flogged one man who became drunk, and ducked more
venial offenders three times from a rope tied at the main-yard.
Their committee of thirty-two (two from each ship), met every
day on the "Queen Charlotte"; it demanded an increase of pay
from 9&nbsp;3/4<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> a day. But when Spencer promised to lay this
request before the King, on condition of immediate restoration
of discipline, the men demurred. Conscious of their power, they
now claimed that rations must be served out, not 12 ounces,
but 16 ounces to the pound; that the power of awarding heavy
punishments for petty offences should be curtailed, extended
opportunities being also granted for going ashore. In vain did
Spencer and his colleagues protest against this dictation of terms.
A personal appeal to the crew of the "Royal George" had no
effect; and when Gardner vehemently reproached the men for
skulking from the French, they ran at him; and he would have
fared badly had he not placed his neck in a noose of a yard-rope
and called on the men to hang him provided they returned
to duty. The men thereupon cheered him and retired.</p>

<p>On 18th April the men's committee formulated their demands
in two manifestoes. Further conferences took place, in one of
which Gardner shook a delegate by the collar and was himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
nearly murdered. The whole fleet then defiantly flew the red
flag. Spencer and his colleagues returned to London for an
interview with Pitt; and along with him and the Lord Chancellor
they posted to Windsor to urge the need of compliance
with the men's demands. Grenville, journeying from Dropmore,
joined them, and a Privy Council was held. Pitt's and
Spencer's views prevailed, and a Royal Proclamation was drawn
up on 22nd April, pardoning the crews if they would return
to duty. A horseman riding at full speed bore the document
to Portsmouth in seven hours, and the fleet, with the
exception of the "Marlborough," re-hoisted the white ensign
and prepared for sea. The discontent rife at Plymouth also
subsided. On 26th April, during a Budget debate, Pitt promised
to provide for the extra pay to seamen and marines.</p>

<p>But on 3rd May an indiscreet opening of the whole question
in the House of Lords by the Duke of Bedford led to a revival
of discontent at Spithead. He upbraided Pitt with delay in
introducing a Bill to give effect to the Royal Proclamation.
Howe thereupon proceeded to justify his former conduct; and
Spencer remarked that he did not expect to receive the King's
commands to bring down any communication on the affair to
the House of Lords. By an unscrupulous use of these remarks
agitators inflamed the crews with the suspicion of ministerial
trickery; and on 7th May, every ship refused to obey Bridport's
orders to weigh anchor. The men arrested Colpoys and sent
fifteen officers on shore. Pitt thereupon, on 8th May, moved a
resolution in the terms of the decision framed at Windsor on
22nd April. He begged the House for a silent vote on this
question; but Fox and Sheridan could not resist the temptation
to accuse him of being the cause of this second mutiny. Clearly
it resulted from the remarks in the House of Lords on 3rd May,
which led the seamen to believe that Pitt was about to play
them false.</p>

<p>The Commons passed the resolution; but Whitbread, on the
morrow, moved a vote of censure on Pitt for delay in dealing
with this important question. Again Pitt pointed out that the
promise given during the Budget debate sufficed for the time,
but he admitted that preliminary forms and inquiries had
absorbed an undue amount of time. Fox and Sheridan pounced
down on this admission, the latter inveighing against the
"criminal and murderous delay" of Ministers, whose incapacity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
earned the contempt of the House. Spying a party advantage
in protracting these debates, Whitbread renewed his attack on
the next day (10th May). Pitt replied with admirable temper,
and showed that the delay in presenting a Bill arose partly from
the action of the Opposition itself. Will it be believed that
Parliament wasted two days, while the navy was in mutiny, in
discussing whether Pitt had or had not been guilty of delay?
The results were deplorable. An anonymous chronicler, hostile
to Pitt, confessed that the men at Spithead were "better pleased
with reading Fox and Sheridan's speeches than with the long-expected
settlement of their claims."<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>In this state of things Pitt despatched Howe ("Black Dick"),
the most popular of the admirals, in order to convince the seamen
of the sincerity of Government. The following is the letter in
which he apprised Bridport of Howe's mission:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Downing Street, <i>May 10, 1797</i>.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>The account we have received this morning led to a great degree of
hope that the distressful embarrassments which you have experienced
may already in a great degree have subsided. You will, however, have
learnt that in the suspense in which we remained yesterday, it had been
determined to send Lord Howe with such instructions under the sign
manual as seemed to us best adapted to the very difficult emergency.
His presenting this commission seems still [more] likely to confirm the
good disposition which had begun to show itself, and his not coming
after the intention had once been announced might lead to unpleasant
consequence [<span lang="la">sic</span>]. It was thought best to make this a civil commission
in order not to interfere with the military command of the fleet, and at
the same time to give the commission to a distinguished naval character,
though not with any naval authority or functions. It was also thought
that making a communication of this nature after all that had passed
through some other channel than the commander of the fleet was for
other reasons preferable and likely to be thought so by you.</p>

<p>I earnestly hope this measure will produce good effects and will both
in itself and in its consequences be satisfactory to you. At all events I
am sure you will continue to contribute your exertions with the same
zeal and public spirit which you have shewn under such trying difficulties
to bring this arduous work, if possible, to a happy termination.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>I hope I need not say how sincerely and deeply, in addition to the
public difficulties, I have felt for the situation in which you have been
placed. If the favourable turn which has been given to affairs should
be happily confirmed, I look forward to the hope that your command
may still be attended with circumstances which may repay you for the
labour and anxiety with which you have had to struggle.</p>
</div>


<p>Howe found it no easy task to vindicate the good faith of
Ministers; but by visiting each ship in turn, he prevailed on the
men to submit to discipline. The 14th of May was a day of
great rejoicing at Spithead; the men's delegates landed and
carried the venerable admiral in triumph to Government House,
where he and his lady entertained them at dinner. Three days
later the whole fleet put to sea.</p>

<p>But already there had fallen on Pitt a still severer blow. On
10th May appeared the first signs of discontent in the ships
anchored off Sheerness. In all probability they may be ascribed
to the factious wrangling at Westminster and the revival of the
mutiny at Spithead on 7th May. Seeing that the demands of
the sailors had been conceded before this outbreak occurred at
the Nore, nothing can be said on behalf of the ringleaders, except
that amidst their worst excesses they professed unswerving
loyalty, firing salutes on 29th May in honour of the restoration
of Charles&nbsp;II and on 4th June for King George's birthday.
Apart from this their conduct was grossly unpatriotic. On 12th
May the crew of H.M.S. "Sandwich," headed by a supernumerary
named Parker, captured the ship, persuaded eleven other crews
to mutiny, and sent delegates to Portsmouth to concert action
with Bridport's fleet.</p>

<p>In this they failed; and, had Vice-Admiral Buckner, in command
at the Nore, acted with vigour, he might have profited by
the discouragement which this news produced. He acted weakly;
and the men paid no heed to the Royal Proclamation issued on
23rd May, offering the same terms as those granted at Portsmouth
and pardon to all who at once returned to duty. Spencer
and his colleagues came from London in the hope of persuading
the men, but in vain. The men sought to tempt the one loyal
ship, the "Clyde," from its duty. Fortunately this Abdiel of a
false company was able to slip off by night and guard the entrance
to Sheerness harbour. Government then hurried up troops
and had new batteries constructed to overawe the fleet. Unfortunately,
at the end of May, thirteen more ships, deserters from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
the fleets of Duncan and Onslow, joined the mutineers at the
Nore. This event might have led to a double disaster. Stout
old Duncan with only two ships sailed on undaunted to the
Texel, where lay a Dutch fleet of fifteen sail preparing for sea.
In order to impose on them he kept flying signals as if to consorts
in the offing, a stratagem which entirely succeeded. The
danger was, however, acute until, acting on Spencer's suggestion,
Vorontzoff ordered a Russian squadron, then in British waters, to
sail to Duncan's help.</p>

<p>Equally serious was the situation at the Nore. The mutineers,
strong in numbers but lacking beef and beer, stopped the navigation
of the Thames and captured provisions from merchantmen,
thus causing a panic in London. On 5th June, after firing the
royal salute, the crews seized some unpopular officers and boatswains,
tarred and feathered them, and landed them at Gravesend,
a spectacle for gods and men. In these and other reckless acts
the fever expended its force. Food and water ran short; for the
banks were strictly guarded, and ships ceased to arrive. The
desperate suggestion of handing the ships over to the Dutch
was frustrated, if it were ever seriously considered, by the removal
of the outer buoys. One by one ships fell away and
replaced the red flag by the white ensign. Enough force was
now at hand to quell the desperate minority; and on 15th June
the "Sandwich," renouncing the authority of Parker, sailed under
the guns of Sheerness. A fortnight later Parker swung from the
yardarm of that ship. His had been a strange career. The son
of a tradesman of Exeter, he is said to have entered the navy
as a midshipman, but to have been thrice dismissed from his ship
for bad conduct. Settling down at Perth, he was imprisoned for
debt, but gained his freedom and also a bounty for enrolling in
the navy as a volunteer. His daring spirit and sturdy frame
brought him to the front in the way that we have seen, the moral
perversity of his nature largely determining the course of the
mutiny at the Nore. After him twenty-two other mutineers were
hanged.</p>

<p>Few men have done more harm to England than Parker. So
heavy a blow did the Nore mutiny deal to credit that 3 per cent.
Consols, which did not fall below 50 at the Bank crisis, sank to
48 in June, the lowest level ever touched in our history. After
the collapse of the mutiny they rose to 55&nbsp;1/2. The serenity of
Pitt never failed during this terrible time. A remarkable proof<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
of his self-possession was given by Spencer. Having to consult
him hastily one night, he repaired to Downing Street and found
that he was asleep. When awakened, he sat up in bed, heard
the case, and gave his instructions, whereupon Spencer withdrew.
Remembering, however, one topic which he had omitted, he
returned, and found him buried in slumber as profound as if he
had not been disturbed. Fox and his friends were far from showing
the same equanimity. Because the House by 256 votes to
91 opposed a motion for Reform which Grey most inopportunely
brought forward in the midst of the mutiny, they decided to leave
Parliament. But the effect of this "secession" was marred by
the occasional reappearance of Sheridan, Tierney, and others
who had loudly advocated it.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> Unpatriotic in conception, it
speedily became ludicrous from its half-hearted execution.</p>

<p>The question has often been raised whether the mutineers
were egged on by malcontent clubs. There are some suspicious
signs. A mutineer on board H.M.S. "Champion" told his captain
that they had received money from a man in a black coat.
This alone is not very convincing. But the malcontents at the Nore
certainly received money, though from what source is uncertain.
The evidence brought before the Committee of Secrecy as to the
connection of the United Irishmen with the mutineers, seems
rather thin. As to French bribery, the loyal sailors at Spithead
in their address to the Nore mutineers bade them not to be any
longer misled by "French principles and their agents, under
whatsoever mask." It was also reported in August 1798 that the
French Government paid an Irishman, Duckett, to go and <em>renew</em>
the mutiny. The officials of the Home Office believed the London
Corresponding Society to be guilty; and on 16th June one of
them, J. K[ing], issued a secret order to two of his agents at
Sheerness to discover whether two members of that society,
named Beck and Galloway, had had dealings with the rebel
crews. The agents, A. Graham and D. Williams, on 24th June
sent to the Duke of Portland the following report, which merits
quotation almost in full:<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>... Mr. Graham and Mr. Williams beg leave to assure his Grace
that they have unremittingly endeavoured to trace if there was any connexion
or correspondence carried on between the mutineers and any
private person or any society on shore, and they think they may with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>the greatest safety pronounce that no such connexion or correspondence
ever did exist. They do not however mean to say that wicked and
designing men have not been among the mutineers; on the contrary
they have proof sufficient to found a belief upon that several whose
mischievous dispositions would lead them to the farthest corner of the
kingdom in hopes of continuing a disturbance once begun have been
in company with the delegates on shore, and have also (some of them)
visited the ships at the Nore, and by using inflammatory language endeavoured
to spirit on the sailors to a continuance of the mutiny, without
however daring to offer anything like a plan for the disposal of the
fleet or to do more than insinuate that they were belonging to clubs or
societies whose members wished well to the cause, but from which
societies Mr. Graham and Mr. Williams are persuaded no such persons
were ever regularly deputed. Neither do they believe that any club or
society in the kingdom or any of those persons who may have found
means of introducing themselves to the delegates have in the smallest
degree been able to influence the proceedings of the mutineers, whose
conduct from the beginning seems to have been of a wild and extravagant
nature not reducible to any sort of form or order and therefore
capable of no other mischief than was to be apprehended from a want
of the fleet to serve against the enemy. In this state however they were
unfortunately suffered to go on without interruption until they began to
think themselves justifiable in what they were doing, and by stopping
up the mouth of the Thames they were suspected of designs for which
Mr. Graham and Mr. Williams can by no means give them credit. The
want of beer and fresh beef prompted them to revenge, and that and
nothing else induced them to interrupt the trade of the river. It was
done on the spur of the occasion, and with a view of obtaining a supply
of fresh provisions. Another thing, namely the systematic appearance
with which the delegates and the sub-committees on board the different
ships conducted the business of the mutiny may be supposed a good
ground of suspecting that better informed men than sailors in general are
must have been employed in regulating it for them. This Mr. Graham
and Mr. Williams at first were inclined to believe too; but in the course
of their examinations of people belonging to the fleet they were perfectly
convinced that without such a combination and with the assistance of
the newspapers only (independent of the many cheap publications to be
had upon subjects relating to clubs and societies of all descriptions)
and the advantage of so many good writers as must have been found
among the quota-men, they were capable of conducting it themselves.</p>
</div>


<p>Graham and Williams arrested at Sheerness three strangers,
Hulm, McLaurin, and McCan, who were making mischief. Nothing
seems to have come of these arrests; and, despite the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
opinion of Pitt, expressed in his speech of 2nd June, we may
dismiss the charge against the London Corresponding Society.
It is clear, however, that busybodies circulated newspapers and
pamphlets at Sheerness, Chatham, and Maidstone. The reports
of the parliamentary debates of 3rd, 8th, 9th, and 10th May
would alone have encouraged the mutineers; and the chiefs of
the Opposition must bear no small share of responsibility for
the disastrous events at Spithead and the Nore. They were
warned that their nagging tactics would cause trouble in the
navy. They persisted, in the hope of discrediting the Ministry.
They succeeded in paralysing the navy; and the only excuse
for their conduct is that their hatred of Pitt blinded them to
the obvious consequences. From this censure I must except
Sheridan, whose speech of 2nd June was patriotic; and he
further is said to have suggested the plan of removing the buoys
beyond the mutinous fleet.</p>

<p>For a brief space disquieting symptoms appeared in the army.
An inflammatory appeal to the troops was distributed at Maidstone
by Henry Fellows; and the same man addressed a letter
to some person unnamed, asking him to send on 100 copies of
the Ulster Address, 50 of "Boniparte's [<span lang="la">sic</span>] Address," 50 of
"the Duke of Richmond's Letter," and 50 of Payne's "Agrarian
Justice." The last named was found among the papers of John
Bone, a member of the London Corresponding Society.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> It is
not unlikely that this propaganda was connected with that at
Chatham barracks, where a seditious handbill was left on 21st
May 1797, urging the men to cast off the tyranny misnamed
discipline, to demand better food, better clothing, and freedom
from restraint in barracks. "The power is all our own," it concludes.
"The regiments which send you this are willing to do
their part. They will show their countrymen they can be
soldiers without being slaves&nbsp;... Be sober, be ready."<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> The
paper was probably connected with the mutiny at the Nore.
There were also some suspicious doings in London barracks.
One of the incendiaries there was, "wicked Williams," who
certainly had run through the whole gamut of evil. First as a
clergyman, he ruined himself by his excesses; then as a penitent
he applied to Wilberforce for relief, and, after disgusting even
that saintly man, he in revenge carried round to certain barracks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>the signature of his would-be benefactor appended to a seditious
appeal. Busybodies lacking all sense of humour therefore
buzzed it about that the abolitionist leader sought to stir up a
mutiny. On 13th May Pitt sent to him to sift any grains of
truth that there might be in this peck of lies. The following
unpublished letter from Wilberforce to Pitt shows that he advised
him to use Williams so as to get at the grains:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">2.20 Sat<sup>y</sup> mng. [<i>May 1797</i>?]<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>Williams has been with Windham and is to wait on him again. The
latter has been with me, and I have been guarding him about W<sup>ms's</sup>
character, telling him that we wish to enable some proper person to
watch W<sup>ms's</sup> motions by becoming acquainted with his person. Now, if
this watch should be at or near Windham's, this point could be obtained.
My other means of making the discovery have failed, and I can devise
no other. Williams avowed to Windham that he had been employed in
endeavouring to inflame the soldiery, but that his mind was not prepared
to go the lengths he found it would be required to go. I am
pretty sure the best way would be to give Williams money, a little, to
infuse a principle of hope. I dare say he is hungry. You must place no
dependence whatever on him, but if he would act for you, he would be
a useful agent, and I think a little money in his case indispensable. I
intreat you not to neglect this. I suppose there will now be no use in
my seeing Ford.</p>
</div>


<p>In a second letter, written an hour later, Wilberforce urges
Pitt not to neglect this note. Williams some years ago sought to
make a mutiny; he was skilled in intrigue, had "held Jacobinical
language, and was going on in the most profligate and abandoned
way." This is all the information that the Pitt MSS. yield upon
this question. But in the private diary of Wilberforce there
is the significant entry: "Pitt awaked by Woolwich artillery
riot and went out to Cabinet." The cool bearing of Lord
Harrington, commander of the forces in London, helped to
restore confidence. On 3rd June Government introduced and
speedily passed a Bill for preventing seduction of the soldiery.
There were rumours of an intended mutiny in the Guards; but
fortunately the troops remained true to duty, and some of
them helped to quell the mutiny at the Nore.</p>

<p>A survey of Pitt's conduct during these critical months
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>reveals the limitations of his nature. He was wanting in foresight.
He seems to have been taken unawares both by the
Bank crisis and the mutinies. He met the financial crisis
promptly when it became acute, though by means which caused
incalculable inconvenience at a later time. The mutinies also
ought to have been averted by timely concessions to the sailors,
who needed increase of pay fully as much as the soldiery. For
this neglect, however, the Admiralty Board, not Pitt, is chiefly
to blame. When the storm burst, Ministers did not display the
necessary initiative and resourcefulness; and the officials of the
Admiralty must be censured for the delay in bringing forward
the proposals on which Parliament could act. The Opposition,
as usual, blamed Pitt alone; and it must be confessed that he
did not exert on officials the almost terrifying influence whereby
Chatham is said to have expedited the preparation of a fleet of
transports. The story to that effect is of doubtful authenticity.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
But there is no doubt that Chatham's personality and behaviour
surpassed those of his son in face of a national crisis. The eagle
eye of the father would have discerned the growth of discontent
in the navy, and his forceful will would have found means to allay
or crush it. Before the thunder of his eloquence the mewlings
of faction must have died away. The younger Pitt was too
hopeful, too soft, for the emergency. But it is only fair to remember
the heartache and ill health besetting him since the
month of January, which doubtless dulled his powers during
the ensuing period of ceaseless strain and anxiety.</p>

<p class="title spaced">NATIONAL REVIVAL</p>

<p class="quote">A common feeling of danger has produced a common spirit of exertion,
and we have cheerfully come forward with a surrender of part of our property,
not merely for recovering ourselves, but for the general recovery of
mankind.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pitt</span>, <i>Speech of 3rd December 1798</i>.</p>


<p>The desire of Pitt for peace with France led him in the
autumn of 1796 to renew more formally the overtures
which he had instituted early in that year. His first offer was
repelled in so insolent a way that the King expressed annoyance
at its renewal being deemed necessary to call forth the spirit of
the British lion. Pitt, however, despatched Lord Malmesbury
on a special mission to Paris; and the slowness of his journey,
due to the bad roads, led Burke to remark: "No wonder it was
slow; for he went all the way on his knees." Pitt's terms were
by no means undignified. He offered that France should keep
San Domingo and her conquests in Europe except those made
from Austria. The French reverses in Swabia and the check to
Bonaparte at Caldiero made the French Directory complaisant
for a time; but his victory at Arcola (17th November), the death
of the Czarina Catharine, and the hope of revolutionizing Ireland,
led it to adopt an imperious tone. Its irrevocable resolve
to keep Belgium and the Rhine boundary appeared in a curt
demand to Malmesbury, either to concede that point or to quit
Paris within forty-eight hours (19th December).<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>It argued singular hopefulness in Pitt that, despite the opposition
of the King, he should make a third effort for peace in
the summer of the year 1797, when the loyalty of the fleet was
open to grave doubt, when rebellion raised its head in Ireland,
and Bonaparte had beaten down the last defences of Austria;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>but so early as 9th April he urged on George the need of making
pacific overtures to Paris, seeing that Austria was at the end
of her resources and seemed on the point of accepting the French
terms. The untoward events of the next weeks deepened his
convictions; and to a letter of the Earl of Carlisle, pressing on
him the urgent need of peace, he replied as follows:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>[<i>Draft.</i>] <i>Private.</i></p>

<p class="letter">Downing St., <i>4 June 1797</i>.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>I can also venture to assure you that I feel not less strongly than
yourself the expediency of taking every step towards peace that can be
likely to effect the object, consistent with the safety and honour of the
country; and I have no difficulty in adding (for your <em>private</em> satisfaction)
that steps are taken of the most direct sort, and of which we must soon
know the result, to ascertain whether the disposition of the enemy will
admit of negotiation. On this point the last accounts from Paris seem
to promise favourably. You will have the goodness to consider the fact
of a step having been actually taken, as confidentially communicated to
yourself.</p>
</div>


<p>Three days previously Pitt had sent to Paris suggestions for
peace. Delacroix, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, whose asperities
were so unbearable in 1796, now replied with courtesy. Pitt
therefore persevered, declaring it to be his duty as a Christian
and a patriot to end so terrible a war. On the other hand
Grenville pronounced the negotiation mischievous at the present
crisis, when the French Government would certainly proffer intolerable
demands. Much, it was true, could be said in favour
of concluding peace before Austria definitely came to terms with
France; and if Russia and Prussia had shown signs of mediating
in our favour, the negotiation might have had a favourable issue.
But neither of those Courts evinced good-will, and that of Berlin
angered Grenville. He therefore strongly opposed the overture to
France, and herein had the support of the three Whig Ministers,
Portland, Spencer, and Windham. The others sided with Pitt,
Lord Liverpool after some hesitation. On 15th June there were
two long and stormy meetings of the Cabinet, the latter lasting
until midnight; but on the morrow, the day after the collapse
of the Nore Mutiny, the Cabinet endorsed the views of Pitt.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>Thereupon Grenville entered a written protest, and wrote to
the King, stating that he would offer his resignation if the times
were not so critical. George thanked him, and in a highly
significant phrase urged him to remain at his post so as "to
stave off many farther humiliations."<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>Malmesbury proceeded to Lille and entered into negotiations
with the French plenipotentiaries, Letourneur, Pl&eacute;ville, and
Maret. The last was he who came on a fruitless errand to
London in January 1793, and finally became Duc de Bassano,
and Foreign Minister under Napoleon. It soon appeared that
the only hope of peace lay in the triumph of the Moderates
over the Jacobins at Paris. The former, who desired peace,
and had an immense majority in the country, at first had the
upper hand in the Chambers. They were willing to give up
some of the French conquests on the Rhine and in the Belgic
Provinces, if their distracted and nearly bankrupt country gained
the boon of peace. Their opponents, weak in numbers, relied on
the armies, and on the fierce fanaticism which clung alike to the
principles and the conquests of the Jacobins. Pitt was willing to
meet France half-way. He consented to leave her in possession
of her "constitutional" frontiers, <span lang="la">i.e.</span>, Belgium, Luxemburg,
Avignon, Savoy, and Nice, besides restoring to her and her
allies all naval conquests, except the Cape of Good Hope and
Trinidad. Ceylon, a recent conquest, was to be reserved for
exchange. So far, but no farther, Pitt consented to go in his
desire for peace. Later on he assured Malmesbury that he
would have given way either on Ceylon or the Cape of Good
Hope. But this latter concession would have galled him deeply;
for, as we shall see, he deemed the possession of the Cape essential
to British interests in the East. Spain's demand for Gibraltar
he waived aside as wholly inadmissible, thus resuming on this
question the attitude which he had taken up in the years 1782&ndash;3.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

<p>Far though Pitt went on the path of conciliation, he did not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>satisfy the haughty spirits dominant at Paris. It was soon
evident that the only means of satisfying them were subterranean;
and a go-between now offered himself. An American,
Melvill, who claimed to be on intimate terms with the most
influential persons at Paris, assured Malmesbury that he could
guarantee the concession of the desired terms, on consideration
of the payment of &pound;450,000 to the leading men at Paris.
Malmesbury at first believed in Melvill's sincerity and sent
him over to see Pitt. They had some interviews at Holwood
at the close of August, apparently to the satisfaction of the
Prime Minister; for, after referring the proposal to Grenville, he
laid it before the King. His reply, dated Weymouth, 9th September,
advised a wary acceptance of the terms, provided that
France also gave up her claim of indemnity for the ships taken
or burnt at Toulon in 1793.</p>

<p>The King did not then know of the <span lang="fr">coup d'&eacute;tat</span> of Fructidor 18
(4th September), whereby Augereau, the right hand of Bonaparte,
coerced the Moderates and installed the Jacobins in power. The
work was done with brutal thoroughness, prominent opponents
being seized and forthwith deported, while the triumphant
minority annulled the elections in forty-nine Departments, and
by unscrupulous pressure compelled voters to endorse the <span lang="la">fiat</span> of
the army. Thus did France plunge once more into a Reign of
Terror, and without the golden hopes which had made the
former experiment bearable. Such was virtually the end of
parliamentary government in France. It is indeed curious that
critics of Pitt, who label his repressive measures a "Reign of
Terror," bestow few words of regret on the despicable acts of
the "Fructidorians," whose policy of leaden repression at home
and filibustering raids abroad made the name of Liberty odious
to her former devotees.</p>

<p>The new tyrants at Paris withheld all news of the <span lang="fr">coup d'&eacute;tat</span>
until they could override the policy of the French plenipotentiaries
at Lille. There it seemed probable that peace might
ensue, when, on 9th September, the first authentic news of
Augereau's violence arrived. Even so, Pitt hoped that the
triumphant faction would be inclined to enjoy their success in
peace. It was not to be. A member of the French embassy at
Lille discerned far more clearly the motives now operating at
Paris, that the new Directory, while making peace with Austria,
would continue the war with England in order to have a pretext<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
for keeping up its armies and acquiring compensations. In any
case the successors of the pacific trio with whom Malmesbury
had almost come to terms, demanded that England should
restore every possession conquered from the French or their
allies. This implied the surrender of the Cape, Ceylon, and
Trinidad, besides minor places on which Pitt and his colleagues
held firm. Brief discussions took place, Malmesbury continuing
to show tact and good temper; but on Sunday, 17th September,
the French plenipotentiaries requested him, if he could not grant
their demands, to leave Lille within twenty-four hours. He departed
early on Monday, reached London by noon of Wednesday,
and saw Grenville and Canning immediately. Pitt, owing
to news of the death of his <span class="ins" title="brother in-law">brother-in-law</span>, Eliot, was too prostrate
with grief to see him until the morrow. It then appeared
that the Directory on 11th September issued a secret order to
its plenipotentiaries to send off Malmesbury within twenty-four
hours if he had not full powers to surrender all Britain's
conquests.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>Even now there was a glimmer of hope. By some secret
channel, Melvill, O'Drusse, or else Boyd the banker, Pitt received
the startling offer, that Talleyrand, if he remained in
favour at Paris, could assure to England the Dutch settlements
in question if a large enough sum were paid over to Barras,
Rewbell, and their clique. Pitt clutched at this straw, and on
22nd September wrote to the King, stating that for &pound;1,200,000
we could retain Ceylon, and for &pound;800,000 the Cape of Good
Hope. While withholding the name of the intermediaries,
known only to himself and Dundas, he strongly urged that
&pound;2,000,000 be paid down when a treaty in this sense was signed
with France, provided that that sum could be presented to
Parliament under the head of secret service. George, now at
Windsor, cannot have been pleased that Pitt and Dundas had
a state secret which was withheld for him; but he replied on the
morrow in terms, part of which Earl Stanhope did not publish.
"I am so thoroughly convinced of the venality of that nation
[France] and the strange methods used by its Directors in carrying
on negotiations that I agree with him [Pitt] in thinking,
strange as the proposal appears, that it may be not without
foundation."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>
<p>George, then, was more sceptical than Pitt; and Grenville and
Malmesbury soon had cause to believe the offer to be merely an
effort of certain Frenchmen to speculate in the English funds.
Nothing came of the matter. Melvill, O'Drusse, and Talleyrand
on the French side, and Boyd in London, seem to have been the
wire-pullers in this affair, which was renewed early in October;
it may have been only a "bull" operation. The secret is hard
to fathom; but Pitt and Dundas were clearly too credulous.
Such was the conclusion of Malmesbury. It tallied with the
pronouncement of Windham, who in one of his captious moods
remarked to Malmesbury that Pitt had no knowledge of the
world, and kept in office by making concessions, and by "tiding
it over." Grenville (he said) thought more of the nation's dignity,
but was almost a recluse. In fact, the Cabinet was ruled by
Dundas, whom Grenville hated. Dundas it was who had sacrificed
Corsica, which involved the loss of Italy.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Windham of
course detested the author of the colonial expeditions, which
had diverted help from the Bretons. In the Chouans alone he
saw hope; for how could England struggle on alone against
France if she could use all the advantages offered by Brest and
Cherbourg?</p>

<p>Much can be said in support of these contentions; for now that
the Directory threw away the scabbard, England felt the need
of the stout Bretons, whose armies had become mere predatory
bands. The last predictions of Burke were therefore justified.
That once mighty intellect expended its last flickering powers
in undignified gibes at the expense of Pitt and his regicide
peace. Fate denied to him the privilege of seeing Malmesbury
again expelled from France and whipped back "like a cur to his
kennel." The great Irishman passed away, amidst inconceivable
gloom, in his 68th year, at Beaconsfield (8th July 1797). In the
view of Windham and other extreme Royalists, Burke was
wholly right, and Pitt's weakness was the cause of all his
country's ills.</p>

<p>We may grant that the summer of the year 1797 was one of
the worst possible times in which to open a negotiation with
triumphant France; for she was certain to exact hard terms
from a power whose credit and whose prestige at sea had
grievously suffered. Nevertheless, the mistake, if mistake it was,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>is venial when compared with the unstatesmanlike arrogance of
the French Directors, who, when an advantageous and brilliant
peace was within their reach, chose to open up a new cycle of
war. Of late France had made use of the pretext that she must
gain her "natural frontiers"&mdash;the Rhine, the Alps, the Pyrenees,
and the Ocean&mdash;for the sake of security against the old dynasties.
By rejecting Pitt's overtures, her leaders now proclaimed their
resolve to dominate Italy and Germany and to secure supremacy
at sea. Their intrigues with British malcontents and the United
Irishmen also showed their determination to revolutionize our
institutions. Thus England was to be abased and insulted,
while France lorded it over all her neighbours and prepared to
become mistress of the seas. The war therefore ceased to be in
any sense a war of principle, and became for France a struggle
for world-wide supremacy, for England a struggle for national
existence; and while democratic enthusiasm waned at Paris, the
old patriotic spirit revived everywhere in Great Britain. The
newspapers were full of appeals for unanimity; and on 20th
November appeared the first number of that bright and patriotic
paper, the "Anti-Jacobin," under the editorship of Canning and
Hookham Frere, which played no small part in arousing
national ardour. On the next day the French Directory issued
an appeal to France to bestir herself to overthrow the British
power, and to dictate peace at London.</p>

<p>There was need of unanimity; for while France was stamping
out revolt, and Great Britain felt increasingly the drag of Ireland,
Pitt encountered an antagonist of unsuspected strength. Over
against his diffuse and tentative policy stood that of Bonaparte,
clear-cut, and for the present everywhere victorious. While Pitt
pursued that will o' the wisp, a money-bought peace, the Corsican
was bullying the Austrian negotiators at Udine and Campo
Formio. Finally his gasconnades carried the day; and on 17th
October Austria signed away her Netherlands to France and her
Milanese and Mantuan territories to the newly created Cisalpine
Republic. Bonaparte and the Emperor, however, agreed to
partition the unoffending Venetian State, the western half of
which went to the Cisalpines, the eastern half, along with
Venice, Istria, and Dalmatia, to the Hapsburgs. The Court of
Vienna struggled hard to gain the Ionian Islands; but on these,
and on Malta, the young general had set his heart as the natural
stepping-stones to Egypt. At the close of the year he returned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
to Paris in triumph, and was invited by the Director, Barras, to
go and conquer England.</p>

<p>Some such effort, either directly against London, or by a deadly
ricochet through Ireland, would have been made, had not Duncan,
on 11th October, crushed the Dutch off Camperdown, taking
nine ships out of fifteen. The consequences were far reaching.
The Dutch navy was paralysed; and without it the squadrons
at Cherbourg and Brest were not yet strong enough to attack
our coasts, until the Toulon and Cadiz fleets sailed northwards.
Bonaparte, who was sent to survey the ports in Flanders and the
north of France, reported to the Directory on 23rd February
1798 that there were fitting out at Brest only ten sail-of-the-line,
which moreover had no crews, and that the preparations
were everywhere so backward as to compel Government to
postpone the invasion until 1799. The wish was father to that
thought. Already he had laid his plans to seize Egypt, and
now strongly advised the orientation of French policy. A third
possible course was the closing of all continental ports against
England, an adumbration of the Continental System of 1806&ndash;13
for assuring the ruin of British commerce.</p>

<p>The news of Camperdown and Campo Formio added vigour
to Pitt's appeal for national union in his great speech of
10th November, in which he gave proofs of the domineering
spirit of the party now triumphant at Paris. Very telling,
also, was his taunt at the Whig press, "which knows no other
use of English liberty but servilely to retail and transcribe
French opinions." Sinclair, who had moved a hostile amendment,
was so impressed as to withdraw it; and thus at last the
violence of the French Jacobins conduced to harmony at
Westminster.</p>

<p>Already there were signs that the struggle was one of financial
endurance. At the close of November 1797 Pitt appealed to the
patriotism of Britons to raise &pound;25,500,000 for the estimated expenses
of the next year, in order to display the wealth and
strength of the kingdom. He therefore proposed to ask the
Bank of England to advance &pound;3,000,000 on Exchequer bills;
and he urged the propertied classes to submit to the trebling of
the Assessed Taxes on inhabited houses, windows, male servants,
horses, carriages, etc. The trebling of these imposts took the
House by surprise, and drew from Tierney, now, in the absence
of Fox, the leader of Opposition, the taunt that Pitt had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
cringe to the Bank for help. A few days later Pitt explained
that the triple duty would fall only upon those who already
paid &pound;3 or more on that score. If the sum paid were less than
&pound;1 it would be halved. Those who paid &pound;3 or more would be
charged at an increasing rate, until, when the sum paid exceeded
&pound;50, the amount would be quadrupled. Nor was this all. By a
third Resolution he outlined the scheme of what was in part a
progressive Income Tax. Incomes under &pound;60 were exempt;
those between &pound;60 and &pound;65 paid at the rate of 2<i>d.</i> in the pound;
and the proportion rose until it reached 2<i>s.</i> in the pound for
incomes of &pound;200 or more.</p>

<p>Though Pitt pointed out the need of a patriotic rejoinder to
the threats of the French Government, the new Assessed Taxes
aroused a furious opposition. "The chief and almost only topic
of conversation is the new taxes," wrote Theresa Parker to
Lady Stanley of Alderley. "How people are to live if the Bill
is passed I know not. I understand the Opposition are much
elated with the hope of the Bill's being passed, as they consider
Mr. Pitt infallibly ruined if it does, and that he must go out."<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>
The patriotism of London equalled that of the Foxites. City
men, forgetting that the present proposals were due to the
shameless evasions of the Assessed Taxes, raised a threatening
din, some of them declaring that Pitt would be assaulted if he
came into the City. Several supporters of Pitt, among them
the Duke of Leeds, Sir William Pulteney and Henry Thornton,
opposed the new imposts, and the Opposition was jubilantly
furious. Sheridan, who returned to the fray, declared that
though the poor escaped these taxes they would starve; for the
wealth which employed them would be dried up. Hobhouse
dubbed the Finance Bill inquisitorial, degrading, and fatal
to the virtues of truthfulness and charity. Squires bemoaned
the loss of horses and carriages and the hard lot of their footmen.
Arthur Young warned Pitt that if the taxes could not be
evaded, gentlemen must sell their estates and live in town.
Bath, he was assured, welcomed the new imposts because they
would drive very many families thither. He begged Pitt to reconsider
his proposals, and, instead of them, to tax "all places
of public diversion, public dinners, clubs, etc., not forgetting
debating societies and Jacobin meetings"; for this would restrain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>"that violent emigration to towns, which the measure dreadfully
threatens."<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>A sign of the hopes of the Opposition was the re-appearance of
Fox. Resuming his long vacant seat, he declared Pitt to be the
author of the country's ruin. For himself, he upheld the funding
system, that is, the plan of shelving the debt upon the future.
The palm for abusiveness was, however, carried off by Nicholls
and Jekyll. The former taunted Pitt with losing all his Allies
and raising France to undreamt-of heights of power, with failing
to gain peace, with exhausting the credit and the resources of
England until now he had to requisition men's incomes. As for
Jekyll, he called the present proposals "a detestable measure of
extortion and rapacity." The debates dragged on, until, after a
powerful reply by Pitt in the small hours of 5th January 1798
the Finance Bill passed the Commons by 196 to 71. The Lords
showed a far better spirit. Carrington declared that Pitt's proposals
did not go far enough. Lord Holland in a maiden speech
pronounced them worse than the progressive taxes of Robespierre.
But Liverpool, Auckland, and Grenville supported the
measure, which passed on 9th January 1798 by 75 to 6.</p>

<p>For a time the Finance Bill injured Pitt's popularity in the
City. During the State procession on 19th December 1797,
when the King, Queen, and Ministers went to St. Paul's to
render thanks for the naval triumphs of that year, he was hooted
by the mob; and on the return his carriage had to be guarded
by a squadron of horse. Nevertheless, it is now clear that Pitt's
proposals were both necessary and salutary. The predictions of
commercial ruin were soon refuted by the trade returns. Imports
in 1798 showed an increase of &pound;6,844,000 over those of 1797;
exports, an increase of &pound;3,974,000. In part, doubtless, these
gratifying results may be ascribed to renewed security at sea, the
bountiful harvest of 1798, and the recent opening up of trade to
Turkey and the Levant. But, under a vicious fiscal system, trade
would not have recovered from the severe depression of 1797.
Amidst all the troubles of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, Pitt
derived comfort from the signs of returning prosperity.</p>

<p>The confidence which he inspired was proved by the success
of a remarkable experiment, the Patriotic Contribution. In the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>midst of the acrid debates on the Finance Bill, the Speaker,
Addington, tactfully suggested the insertion of a clause enabling
the Bank of England to receive voluntary gifts, amounting
to one-fifth of the income. Pitt gratefully adopted the proposal,
and early in the year 1798 patriots began to send in large
sums. Pitt, Addington, Dundas, the Lord Chancellor, and
Lords Kenyon and Romney at once gave &pound;2,000 each; the
King graciously allotted from the Privy Purse &pound;20,000 a year
during the war. The generous impulse speedily prevailed, and
the City once more showed its patriotism by subscribing &pound;10,000;
the Bank gave &pound;200,000. A platform was erected near the Royal
Exchange for the receipt of contributions. Among others, a
wealthy calico printer, Robert Peel, father of the statesman, felt
the call of duty to give &pound;10,000. He went back to Bury (Lancashire)
in some anxiety to inform his partner, Yates, of this
unbusinesslike conduct, whereupon the latter remarked, "You
might as well have made it &pound;20,000 while you were about it." If
all Britons had acted in this spirit, the new taxes would have
met the needs of the war. But, as will subsequently appear,
they failed to balance the ever growing expenditure, and Pitt in
1799&ndash;1800 had to raise loans on the security of the Income Tax
to make up its deficiencies.</p>

<p>A pleasing proof of the restoration of friendship between
Auckland and Pitt appears in a letter in which the former asked
advice as to the amount which he should give to this fund. He
was now Postmaster-General, and stated that his total gross income
was &pound;3,600, out of which the new taxes took &pound;320. Should
he give &pound;1,000? And what should he give for his brother, Morton
Eden, ambassador at Vienna? Pitt answered that &pound;700
should be the utmost for him; the sum of &pound;500 for Morton
would also be generous.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> On the whole, &pound;2,300,000 was subscribed&mdash;a
sum which contrasts remarkably with the driblets
that came in as a response to Necker's appeal in the autumn of
1789 for a patriotic contribution of one fourth of the incomes of
Frenchmen.</p>

<p>Even so, Pitt had to impose new taxes in his Budget of 1798,
and to raise a loan of &pound;3,000,000. Further, on 2nd April, he
proposed a commutation of the Land Tax. Of late it had been
voted annually at the rate of 4<i>s.</i> in the pound, and produced about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>&pound;2,000,000. Pitt now proposed to make it a perpetual charge
upon parishes, but to enable owners to redeem their land from
the tax at the existing valuation. The sums accruing from these
sales were to go to the reduction of the National Debt. His aim,
that of enhancing credit, was as praiseworthy as his procedure
was defective. For there had been no valuation of the land for
many years, and the assessments varied in the most surprising
manner even in neighbouring districts. Doubtless it was impossible
during the Great War to carry out the expensive and
lengthy process of a national valuation; but, as manufactures
and mining were creating a new Industrial England, the time
was most unsuited to the imposition of a fixed quota of Land
Tax.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Pitt took as basis the assessment of 1797, and
made it a perpetual charge upon each parish. The results have
in many cases been most incongruous. Agricultural land, which
was generally rated high, continued to pay at that level long
after depreciation set in. On the other hand, large tracts in the
manufacturing districts, rapidly increasing in value, paid far less
than their due share. In some cases where a barren moor has
become a hive of industry, the parish now raises its quota by a
rate of .001 in the pound. In a few cases, where the fall in value
has been severe, the rate is very heavy, in spite of remedial
legislation. Pitt could not have foreseen differences such as
these; but, in view of the rapid growth of manufactures in the
Midlands and North, he should have ensured either a re-valuation
of the parochial quotas or a complete and methodical redemption
from the Land Tax. He took neither course, and that, too,
in spite of the warnings of Lord Sheffield and Sinclair as to the
injustice and impolicy of his proposals. They passed both
Houses by large majorities, perhaps because he offered to landlords
the option of redeeming their land at twenty years' purchase.
Less than one fourth of the tax was redeemed before the
year 1800, a fact which seems to show that the landed interest
was too hard pressed to profit by the opportunity. As Sir Francis
Burdett said, country gentlemen had to bear a heavy burden of
taxation, besides poor-rates, tithes, and the expense of the
mounted yeomanry. Thurlow compared the country magnates
to sheep who let themselves be shorn and re-shorn, whereas
merchants and traders were like hogs, grunting and bolting as
soon as one bristle was touched. In defence of Pitt's action, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
may be said that he hoped to secure a considerable gain by the
investment of the purchase money in Consols and to enhance
their value; but it appears that not more than &pound;80,000 a year
was thus realized.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>The prevalence of discontent early in 1798 and the threatened
coalition of Irish and British malcontents will be noticed in the
<a href="#CHAPTER_XVI">following chapter</a>. Pitt was so impressed by the danger as to
press for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act and the renewal
of the Aliens Act (April 1798). As happened in 1794, the
revival of coercion produced vehement protests. Already the
Duke of Norfolk had flung defiance at Ministers. Presiding at a
great banquet held at the Crown and Anchor, on the occasion of
Fox's birthday, 24th January, he not only compared the great
orator to Washington, but hinted that the 2,000 men present
might do as much as Washington's handful had done in America.
Finally he proposed the distinctly Jacobinical toast, "Our Sovereign,
the Majesty of the People." For this he was dismissed
from the command of a militia regiment and from the Lord
Lieutenancy of the West Riding of Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Fox chose to repeat the toast early in May 1798, when large
parts of Ireland were on the brink of revolt. In so dire a crisis
it behoved a leading man to weigh his words. But the wilful
strain in his nature set all prudence at defiance. Thereupon
several of Pitt's friends recommended a public prosecution for
sedition, or at least a reprimand at the bar of the House of Commons.
To the former course Pitt objected as giving Fox too
much consequence, besides running the risk of an acquittal; but
he saw some advantage in the latter course; for (as he wrote to
Dundas) Fox, when irritated by the reprimand, would probably
offer a new insult and could then be sent to the Tower for the
rest of the Session. The suggestion is perhaps the pettiest in
the whole of Pitt's correspondence; but probably it was due to
the extremely grave situation in Ireland and the fear of a French
invasion. Further, Fox had ceased to attend the House of Commons;
and a member who shirks his duty is doubly guilty when
he proposes a seditious toast. Pitt, however, did not push
matters to extremes, and the course actually adopted was the
removal of the name of Fox from the Privy Council by the hand
of George&nbsp;III on 9th May.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>
<p>Sixteen days later, Pitt and Tierney had a passage of arms in
the House. That pugnacious Irishman had thrust himself to the
fore during the secession of Fox and other prominent Whigs
from the House, and had to bear many reproaches for his officiousness.
He also nagged at Pitt at every opportunity, until, on
his opposing a motion of urgency for a Bill for better manning
the Navy, Pitt's patience gave way. He accused the self-constituted
leader of seeking to obstruct the defence of the country.
The charge was in the main correct; for Tierney's opposition to
a pressing measure of national defence was highly unpatriotic.
Nevertheless, Tierney had right on his side when he called Pitt
to order and appealed to the Speaker for protection. Rarely has
that personage been placed in a more difficult position. Pitt was
right in his facts; but etiquette required that he should withdraw
or at least attenuate his charge. Addington politely hinted that
the words were unparliamentary, but suggested that the Minister
should give an explanation. Pitt stiffly refused either to withdraw
his words, or to explain their meaning. There the incident
closed. On the next day, Saturday, 26th May, Tierney sent Pitt
a challenge, which was at once accepted.</p>

<p>We find it difficult now to take seriously a duel between a slim
man of near forty who had rarely fired a shot in sport, never in
anger, and a stoutly built irascible Irishman, for whom a good
shot meant lynching or lasting opprobrium. Visions of Bob
Acres and Sir Lucius O'Trigger flit before us. We picture
Tierney quoting "fighting Bob Acres" as to the advantage of a
sideways posture; and we wonder whether the seconds, if only
in regard for their own safety, did not omit to insert bullets.
The ludicrous side of the affair soon dawned on contemporaries,
witness the suggestion that in all fairness Pitt's figure ought to
be chalked out on Tierney's, and that no shot taking effect outside
ought to count. But, on the whole, people took the incident
seriously. Certainly the principals did. Pitt made his will
beforehand, and requested Addington as a friend to come and
see him, thereby preventing his interposition as Speaker. He
asked Steele to be his second; but, he being away from town,
Dudley Ryder took his place. Leaving Downing Street about
noon on Whitsunday, 27th May, the pair walked along Birdcage
Walk, mounted the steps leading into Queen Street, and entered
a chaise engaged for their excursion. After passing the villages
of Chelsea and Putney, and, topping the rise beyond, they proceeded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
along the old Portsmouth Road, which crosses the
northern part of Putney Heath. At the top of the steep hill
leading down into Kingston Vale they alighted, made their way
past the gibbet where swung the corpse of a well-known highwayman,
Jerry Abershaw, long the terror of travellers on that road.
Did Pitt know that libellers likened him to the highwayman;
for "Jerry took purses with his pistols, and Pitt with his Parliaments"?
Lower down Pitt and Ryder found Tierney and his
second, General Walpole, in a charming dell radiant with golden
gorse and silver birches.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

<p>But they were not alone. That fine Whitsuntide had brought
many chaises along the road; and not a few curious persons
skirted the rising ground towards Putney and Wimbledon. To
these inquisitive groups rode up a tall bland-looking man, now
more than usually sedate. It was Addington. Probably he was
the most anxious man alive. He knew that his weakness as
Speaker had freed Pitt from the necessity of apologizing to
Tierney as the occasion demanded. Now, too, as Speaker, he
ought to intervene. As a friend, pledged by Pitt to secrecy, he
could do nothing but look on. Below, in the dell, the seconds
saw to the pistols and measured the distance&mdash;twelve paces.
Pitt and Tierney coolly took aim, and, at the signal, fired.
Addington's heart must have leaped with joy to see Pitt's figure
still erect. Again the seconds produced pistols, and again the
pair fired: but this time Pitt discharged his weapon into the air.
Was it a sign of his contrition for his insult to Tierney, or of his
chivalrous sense of Tierney's disadvantage in the matter of
target-space? Certain it is that Walpole leaped over the furze
bushes for joy on seeing the duellists still erect.</p>

<p>Thus ended the duel, to the satisfaction of all present. Pitt
had behaved with spirit, and Tierney had achieved immortal
fame. But that the duel was fought at all caused deep concern.
Hannah More was inexpressibly shocked at the desecration of
Whitsunday; Wilberforce also was deeply pained. Indeed, he
deemed the matter so serious as to propose to give notice of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>motion for preventing duelling; but he dropped it on Pitt frankly
assuring him that, if carried, it would involve his resignation.
George&nbsp;III signified to Chatham his decided disapproval, and
expressed to Pitt a desire that such an incident should never
occur again. "Public characters," he added, "have no right to
weigh alone what they owe to themselves; they must consider
what they owe to their country." Thomas Pitt strongly reprobated
the conduct of Tierney in challenging Pitt; for we find the
latter replying to him on 30th May: "I shall feel great concern
if the feelings of my friends betray them into any observations
on Mr. Tierney's conduct reproachful or in the smallest degree
unfavourable to him, being convinced that he does not merit
them." This is the letter of a spirited gentleman. Buckingham
evidently sympathized with Thomas Pitt; for he expressed his
surprise that the Prime Minister should risk his life against such
a man as Tierney. A more jocular tone was taken by the Earl
of Mornington, soon to become the Marquis Wellesley. Writing
to Pitt from Fort St. George on 8th August 1799 (three months
after the capture of Seringapatam), he expressed strong approval
of his Irish policy and concluded as follows: "I send you by
Henry a pair of pistols found in the palace at Seringapatam.
They are mounted in gold and were given by the late King of
France to the 'citizen Sultan' (Tippoo). They will, I hope, answer
better for your next Jacobin duel than those you used
under Abershaw's gibbet."<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>&mdash;What became of those pistols?</p>

<p>The general opinion was adverse to Pitt's conduct. For at
that time the outlook in Ireland could scarcely have been
gloomier, and Bonaparte's armada at Toulon was believed to be
destined for those shores. In such a case, despite the nice
punctilio of honour, neither ought Tierney to have sent a challenge
nor Pitt to have accepted it. The recklessness of Pitt in
this affair is, however, typical of the mood of the British people in
the spring and summer of that year. The victories of Jervis and
Duncan, the rejection of Pitt's offers of peace by the French
Directory, and its threats to invade these shores, aroused the
fighting spirit of the race. As the war became a struggle for
existence, all thoughts of surrender vanished. The prevalent
feeling was one of defiance. It was nurtured by Canning in the
"Anti-Jacobin," in which he lampooned the French democrats
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>and their British well-wishers. Under the thin disguise of "the
Friend of Humanity" he satirized Tierney in the poem, "The
Knife-Grinder," a parody, in form, of Southey's "Widow," and,
in meaning, of Tierney's philanthropic appeals. In a play, "The
Rovers," he sportfully satirized the romantic drama of Schiller,
"The Robbers." In one of the incidental poems he represented
the hero, while in prison, recalling the bright days</p>

<p>A Prime Minister who can throw off squibs, and a nation that
can enjoy them, will not succumb even in the worst crisis.</p>

<p>In truth, all patriots were now straining their utmost to repel
an aggressive and insolent enemy. The Volunteer Movement
more than ever called forth the manly exertions of the people;
and one of the most popular caricatures of the time (May 1798)
shows Pitt as a Volunteer standing rigidly at attention. Sermons,
caricatures, pamphlets, and songs, especially those of Dibdin,
served to stimulate martial ardour. Singular to relate,
Hannah More (now in her fifty-third year) figured among the
patriotic pamphleteers, her "Cheap Repository" of political
tracts being an effective antidote to the Jacobinical leaflets
which once had a hold on the poorer classes. Space will not
admit of an account of all the agencies which heralded the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>dawn of a more resolute patriotism. Though the methods were
varied, the soul of them all was Pitt.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>The tone of public opinion astonished that experienced writer,
Mallet du Pan, who, on coming from the Continent to England,
described the change of spirit as astounding. There the monarchical
States, utterly devoid of dignity and patriotism, were
squabbling over the details of a shameful peace. "Here," he
writes in May 1798, "we are in the full tide of war, crushed by
taxation, and exposed to the fury of the most desperate of
enemies, but nevertheless security, abundance, and energy reign
supreme, alike in cottage and palace. I have not met with a
single instance of nervousness or apprehension. The spectacle
presented by public opinion has far surpassed my expectation.
The nation had not yet learnt to know its own strength or its
resources. The Government has taught it the secret, and inspired
it with an unbounded confidence almost amounting to presumption."
No more striking tribute has been paid by a foreigner to
the dauntless spirit of Britons. Rarely have they begun a war
well; for the careless ways of the race tell against the methodical
preparation to which continental States must perforce submit.
England, therefore, always loses in the first rounds of a
fight. But, if she finds a good leader, she slowly and wastefully
repairs the early losses. In September 1797 the French Directory
made the unpardonable mistake of compelling her to prepare
for a war to the knife. Thenceforth the hesitations of Pitt,
which had weakened his war policy in 1795&ndash;6, vanished; and he
now stood forth as the inspirer of his countrymen in a contest
on behalf of their national existence and the future independence
of Europe.</p>

<p class="title spaced">THE IRISH REBELLION</p>

<p class="quote">The dark destiny of Ireland, as usual, triumphed.&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. Moore</span>, <i>Mems. of
Lord Edward Fitzgerald</i>.</p>


<p>Various orders of minds ascribe the Irish Rebellion of
1798 to widely different causes. The ethnologist sees in it
the incompatibility of Celt and Saxon. To the geographer it
may yield proofs of Nature's design to make Ireland a nation.
If approached from the religious standpoint, it will be set down
either to Jesuits or to the great schism of Luther. The historian
or jurist may trace its origins back to the long series of wrongs
inflicted by a dominant on a subject race. Fanatical Irishmen
see in it a natural result of the rule of "the base and bloody
Saxon"; and Whig historians ascribe it to Pitt's unworthy treatment
of that most enlightened of Lords-Lieutenant, Earl Fitzwilliam.
Passing by the remoter causes, I must very briefly
notice the last topic.</p>

<p>The appointment of the Whig magnate, Fitzwilliam, to the
Irish Viceroyalty in 1794 resulted from the recent accession of
the "Old Whigs," led by the Duke of Portland, to the ministerial
ranks. That union, as we have seen, was a fertile cause of
friction. Fitzwilliam was at first President of the Council; but
that post did not satisfy the nephew and heir of the Marquis of
Rockingham. He aspired to the Viceroyalty at Dublin; and
Portland, who, as Home Secretary, supervised Irish affairs,
claimed it for him. Pitt consented, provided that a suitable appointment
could be arranged for the present Viceroy, the Earl
of Westmorland. This was far from easy. Ultimately the position
of Master of the Horse was found for him; but, long before
this decision was formed, Fitzwilliam wrote to the Irish patriot,
Grattan, asking him and his friends, the Ponsonbys, for their
support during his Viceroyalty. This move implied a complete<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
change of system at Dublin, Grattan and the Ponsonbys having
declared for the admission of Roman Catholics to the then exclusively
Protestant Parliament. True, this reform seemed a
natural sequel to Pitt's action in according to British Catholics
the right of public worship and of the construction of schools
(1791). Further, in 1792, he urged Westmorland to favour the
repeal of the remaining penal laws against Irish Catholics; but
the Dublin Parliament decisively rejected the proposal. Nevertheless,
in 1793 he induced Westmorland to support the extension
of the franchise to Romanists, a measure which seemed to
foreshadow their admission to Parliament itself. There is little
doubt that Pitt, who then expected the war to be short, intended
to set the crown to this emancipating policy; for even in the
dark times that followed he uttered not a word which implied
permanent hostility to the claims of Catholics. His attitude
was that of one who awaited a fit opportunity for satisfying them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the overtures of Fitzwilliam to Grattan and
the Ponsonbys became known at Dublin, with results most
humiliating for Westmorland. The exultation of the Ponsonbys
and the Opposition aroused the hopes of Catholics and the
resentment of the more extreme Protestants. Chief among the
champions of the existing order was the Irish Lord Chancellor,
Baron Fitzgibbon, afterwards Earl of Clare. A man of
keen intellect and indomitable will, he swayed the House of
Lords, the Irish Bar, and the Viceregal councils. It was he
who had urged severe measures against the new and powerful
organization, the United Irishmen, started in Ulster by Wolfe
Tone, which aimed at banding together men of both religions in
a solid national phalanx. Scarcely less influential than Fitzgibbon
was Beresford, the chief of the Revenue Department,
whose family connections and control of patronage were so extensive
as to earn him the name of the King of Ireland. Like
Fitzgibbon he bitterly opposed any further concession to Catholics;
and it was therefore believed that the dismissal of these
two men was a needful preliminary to the passing of that important
measure. Rumours of sweeping changes began to fly
about, especially when Grattan came to London, and had interviews
with the Lord Chancellor. The frequent shifts whereby
the Scottish Presbyterian, Wedderburn, became the reactionary
Lord Loughborough were notorious; and it is one of the suspicious
features of the Fitzwilliam affair that he, now Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
Chancellor of Great Britain, should urge Pitt to treat Fitzwilliam
with the confidence due to his prospective dignity. The
Attorney-General, Sir Richard Pepper Arden, sent to Pitt the
following caution:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter"><i>September 1794</i>.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p>... My wife says she dined the other day with Grattan at the Chancellor's.
I am sadly afraid that preferment in Ireland will run too much
in favour of those who have not been the most staunch friends of
Government; but, pray, for God's sake, take care that the new Lord
Lieutenant does not throw the Government back into the hands of
Lord Shannon and the Ponsonbys, nor turn out those who behaved
well during the King's illness to make way for those who behaved
directly the reverse. Excuse my anxiety on this head but I fear there is
good reason for it.</p>
</div>


<p>Arden was correctly informed. Now or a little later, Fitzwilliam
formed the resolve to dismiss Fitzgibbon and Beresford.
On the other hand, the lowering outlook in Holland in the
autumn of 1794 induced in Pitt the conviction that the time had
not yet come for sweeping changes at Dublin. Accordingly, late
in October, or early in November, he and Grenville thoroughly
discussed this subject with the newly appointed Ministers,
Portland, Fitzwilliam, Spencer, and Windham. Grenville's account
of this conference, which has but recently seen the light,
refutes the oft repeated statement,<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> that Pitt accorded to Fitzwilliam
a free hand at Dublin. On the contrary, it was agreed,
apparently with the full consent of the Viceroy-elect, that he
should make no change of system.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> Fully consonant with this
decision was the reply of Pitt to Sir John Parnell, Grattan, and
the two Ponsonbys, who in the third week of November 1794
begged him to lower the duties on inter-insular imports. While
expressing his complete sympathy with their request, he declared
the present critical time to be inopportune for a change
which must arouse clamour and prejudice.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> The conduct of
Fitzwilliam was far different. Landing near Dublin on 4th
January 1795, he on the 7th sent Daly to request Beresford to
retire from office. Beresford refused, and sent off an appeal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>to his old friend, Auckland, with the result that the Cabinet
soon met to consider the questions aroused by this and other
curt dismissals. It being clear that Fitzwilliam was working with
the Ponsonbys for a complete change of system, he was asked
to modify his conduct. He refused to do so.</p>

<p>The King now intervened in an unusually incisive manner.
He informed Pitt that it would be better to recall Fitzwilliam
than to allow further concessions to Catholics, a subject which
was "beyond the decision of any Cabinet of Ministers." Accordingly,
Fitzwilliam was recalled, his departure from Dublin arousing
a storm of indignation which bade fair to overwhelm the
Administration of his successor, Earl Camden.</p>

<p>Such is a brief outline of the Fitzwilliam affair. No event
could have been more unfortunate. It led Irish patriots and the
Whigs at Westminster to inveigh against the perfidy and tyranny
of Pitt. He was unable to publish documents in his own defence,
while Fitzwilliam crowned his indiscretions by writing two
lengthy letters charging the Cabinet with breach of faith and
Beresford with peculation. Nominally private, they were published
at Dublin, with the result that Pitt and Camden were held
up to execration and contempt. On reviewing this question, we
may conclude that Pitt erred in not procuring from Fitzwilliam
a written statement that he would make no sweeping changes at
Dublin, either in regard to men or measures, without the consent
of the Cabinet. It is, however, clear that Ministers regarded the
verbal understanding with Fitzwilliam as binding; for Grenville,
Portland, Spencer, and Windham sided with Pitt in this painful
dispute, Portland's chilling behaviour to the Earl on his return
marking his disapproval of his conduct.</p>

<p>Never did a Lord-Lieutenant enter on his duties under auspices
more threatening than those besetting the arrival of Camden on
31st March 1795. After the swearing-in ceremony the passions
of the Dublin mob broke loose. Stones were flung at the carriages
of the Primate and Fitzgibbon. The rabble then attacked
the Speaker's residence and the Custom House, and not till two
of their number fell dead under a volley of the soldiery did the
rioters disperse. The rebellion which Fitzwilliam predicted on
his departure seemed to be at hand.</p>

<p>Camden, on whom this storm was to burst three years later,
was not a strong man. He entered on his duties doubtfully and
before long sent requests for his recall on account of his family<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
concerns. He might well quail at the magnitude of his task.
His instructions bade him by all available means discourage the
claims of the Catholics, and rally the discouraged Protestants.
Thereafter he might conciliate the Catholics by promising relief
for their parochial clergy, the foundation of a seminary for the
training of their priests, and some measure of education for the
peasantry. The instructions ended thus: "Moderate, soothe,
conciliate these jarring spirits. We have great confidence in
your judgment, firmness, discretion."<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> The despatch refutes the
oft-repeated assertion that the Ministry sought to inflame the
animosities of Protestants and Catholics in order to force on
the Union. That was the outcome of the whole situation; but in
the spring of 1795 Ministers hoped to calm the ferment, which
they rightly ascribed to the imprudence of Fitzwilliam. Their
forecast for a time came true. In the first debates at Dublin the
lead given by Camden's able Secretary, Pelham, served to close
the schism in the Protestant ranks. Despite the vehement efforts
of Grattan, his Bill for the admission of Catholics was thrown
out by a majority of more than one hundred; and Ireland entered
once more on the dreary path of reaction.</p>

<p>In the hope of softening the asperities of Irish life, Pitt
favoured the plan of founding a seminary for the training of
Catholic priests in Ireland. The proposal was alike one of
justice and expediency; of justice, because the expense of
training Irish priests in foreign seminaries had been a sore
burden to their co-religionists; and of expediency, because the
change promised to assuage the anti-British prejudices of the
priests. Moreover, amidst the sweeping triumph of secularism
in France and Belgium, most of the seminaries frequented by
Irish youths had disappeared. The chief objections urged
against the scheme were the narrowness of view certain to
result from the curriculum of a semi-monastic institution, and
the desirability of educating priests at Trinity College along
with Protestants. On these grounds we must regret Pitt's decision
to found a separate training college, albeit at first intended
for the education of lay youths as well. The considerations
above set forth, however, prevailed; and the chief legislative
result of the year 1795 at Dublin was the charter establishing
Maynooth College. Undoubtedly it was the outcome of Pitt's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>desire to pacify Catholic Ireland; but the unhappy conditions of
the ensuing period told heavily against success. Indeed, as Wolfe
Tone predicted, that institution fostered insular patriotism of a
somewhat narrow type.</p>

<p>The trend of things in the years 1795&ndash;7 set steadily towards
rebellion. The discontent was most threatening among the
sturdy Presbyterians of Ulster, chafed as they were by the
exaction of tithes by the Protestant Established Church. The
founders and the ablest leaders of the League of United Irishmen
were Protestants. For a time they aimed merely at a
drastic measure of Parliamentary Reform similar to that advocated
by English Radicals. But the disappointment of the hopes
of Grattan and Irish Whigs in the spring of 1795 exasperated
all sections of reformers and impelled the League towards revolutionary
courses. Sops like Maynooth they rejected with
scorn; and at the close of that year, after the passing of certain
repressive measures, their organization became secret; they
imposed an oath on members and gradually devised means for
organizing the whole of Ireland in brotherhoods, which by
means of district and county delegations, carried out the behests
of the central committee at Dublin.</p>

<p>Yet their system was far from absorbing the whole of the
nation. The vivacity of the Celt and the hardness of the Saxon
tell against close union; and where the two races dwell side by
side, solidarity is a dream. Now, as always, in times of excitement
the old animosities burst forth. The Catholic peasantry
banded together in clubs, known as Defenders, to glut their
hatred upon Protestant landlords and tithe-reaping clergy. Their
motives seem in the main to have been agrarian rather than
religious; but, as in Leinster, Munster, and Connaught the
dividing lines between landlords and peasants were almost
identical with those between Protestants and Catholics, the land
feud became a war of creed. The ensuing horrors, midnight
attacks, cattle-maiming, and retaliation by armed yeomanry,
exerted a sinister influence upon Ulster, where the masses were
fiercely Protestant. Certain of the Catholic villages were ravaged
by Protestant Peep o' Day Boys, until the Irishry fled in
terror to the South or West, there wreaking their vengeance
upon squires and parsons. By degrees the Peep o' Day Boys
became known as Orangemen, whose defiant loyalty sometimes
caused concern to Camden and Pitt; while the Defenders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
joined the better drilled ranks of United Ireland, which therefore
became a preponderatingly Catholic body.</p>

<p>Thus affairs revolved in the old vicious circle. Feuds, racial,
religious, and agrarian, rent Ireland asunder. Disputes about
land have ever sunk deep into the brooding imagination of the
Celt; and the memories of holdings absorbed, or of tithes
pitilessly exacted in lean years, now flashed forth in many a
deed of incendiarism or outrage. To Camden there appeared to
be only one means of cure, coercion. An Indemnity Act was
therefore passed to safeguard squires and yeomen who took the
law into their own hands. Then followed the Insurrection Act,
for disarming the disaffected, and the suspension of the Habeas
Corpus Act for strengthening the arm of the law.</p>

<p>The outcome was that the United Irishmen turned towards
France. Even in the year 1793 the Republic sent agents into
Ireland to stir up revolt. Nothing definite came of those efforts,
except that a section of Irish patriots thenceforth began to
strive for separation from Great Britain. Early in 1796 Wolfe
Tone proceeded to Paris to arrange for the despatch of a French
auxiliary corps. On 20th April General Clarke, head of the
Topographical Bureau at the War Office, agreed to send 10,000
men and 20,000 stand of arms. The mercurial Irishman encountered
endless delays, and was often a prey to melancholy;
but the news of Bonaparte's victories in Italy led him to picture
the triumph of the French Grenadiers in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p>Another interesting figure is that of Lord Edward Fitzgerald.
Sprung from the ancient line of the Geraldines, and son of the
Duke of Leinster, he plunged into life with the gaiety and
bravery of a Celt. After serving with distinction in the British
army in America he returned, became a member of the Irish
Parliament, and in 1790 during the acute friction with Spain,
received from his uncle, the Duke of Richmond, an introduction
to Pitt, who offered him the command of an expedition
against Cadiz. Nothing came of the proposal; but the incident
reveals the esteem in which the chivalrous young officer was held.
He soon married Pamela, the reputed daughter of the Duke of
Orleans and Mme. de Genlis, whence he himself was often dubbed
"Egalit&eacute;." The repressive policy of Camden made him a rebel;
and in May 1796 he made his way to Hamburg, hoping to concert<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
plans for a French invasion. There he was joined by Arthur
O'Connor, who impressed Reinhard with a sense of ability and
power. Together the two Irishmen travelled to Basle, where they
induced Barth&eacute;lemy to favour their scheme. Meanwhile the
French Directory entered into the plan of Wolfe Tone; the
mission of Fitzgerald had no direct result, apart from the revelation
of his plan to a travelling companion, who had been the
mistress of a British Minister, and now forwarded a description
of it to London.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Wolfe Tone had sketched the outline of the
enterprise to Clarke and General Hoche, predicting to the latter,
the commander-elect, that he would "amputate the right hand
of England for ever."<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> As is well known, Hoche's expedition to
Bantry Bay at the close of the year 1796 was an utter failure;
and the sterner spirits in Ulster believed that the French had
designed that it should end so. The malcontents therefore relaxed
their efforts for a time, until, in the spring following, the
mutinies in the British fleet aroused new hopes. It seems probable
that their intrigues had some effect on events at the Nore.
In quick succession United Ireland despatched to Paris two
delegates, named Lewins and McNevin, to concert plans for
another landing. The Directory sent an agent to treat with the
League. Fitzgerald met him in London, and declared that the
Irish Militia and Yeomanry would join the French on their
landing. The United Irishmen also sought help from Spain.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<p>In Ireland the organisation went on apace until Camden
struck sharp blows through the military. In the middle of May
1797, when the malcontents were excited by news of the second
mutiny at Portsmouth, they rose in the North, but in three or
four engagements the loyal Militia and Yeomanry broke up their
bands. The South remained quiet, and the efforts to seduce the
army and Militia were fruitless; but Lord Clifden, writing to
Abbot on 15th May, predicted a general rising when the French
attempted a second invasion, as they certainly would.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> On 19th
June Beresford wrote from Dublin to Auckland, stating that, but
for the repressive measures and wholesale seizures of arms, not a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>loyalist's head would have been safe.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> The spring of 1797 was
indeed a time of great risk. But for the weakness of the Dutch
and French navies, a landing in Ireland could have taken place
with every chance of success. As it was, Camden's vigorous
measures so far cowed the malcontents that the rebellion was
deferred for a year. This respite probably saved the British
Empire. Amidst the financial and naval difficulties of the first
half of the year 1797, a telling blow struck at Ireland could
scarcely have failed of success. Rarely were the enemies of
England so formidable; never were her means of defence so
weak. Fortunately, no blow was aimed at her until the month
of October; and then, when the Dutch fleet set out to convoy
an expedition to Ireland, it was utterly crushed by Duncan at
Camperdown. There was therefore little risk of an invasion in
force after October 1797, the very month which saw Napoleon
Bonaparte set free from his lengthy negotiations with Austria.
Verily, if Fortune pressed hard on Pitt at Toulon and in Flanders
and Hayti, she more than redressed the balance by her
boons at sea in the year 1797.</p>

<p>Camden's letters to Pitt reveal the imminence of bankruptcy
in Ireland throughout that year; and it is noteworthy that the
loan raised for the Irish Government in January and February was
the final cause of the Bank crisis in London. Even so, the Irish
Exchequer was in dire need. On 25th April Camden informed
Pitt that only &pound;8,000 remained in the Exchequer, and he had
no means for equipping the troops if the French should land.
The sum of &pound;200,000 must be sent at once. Such a demand at
that time was impossible; and not until the end of May could
Pitt forward the half of that sum, Camden meanwhile borrowing
money in Dublin at 8&nbsp;3/8 per cent. On 1st June he wrote to Pitt
a confidential letter, laying bare his real aims. He urged him
to do all in his power to procure peace from France. He had
recommended this step in April; but now his language was most
insistent. Assuming that it would be sheer madness to tempt
fortune in another campaign, he suggested that, if the French
terms were too onerous, Pitt should leave it to another Prime
Minister to frame a peace. But whatever happened, Pitt must
not lower his dignity by conceding Reform and Catholic Emancipation
in Great Britain and Ireland. If those measures were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>inevitable, others must carry them. The latter would only satisfy
the Irish Catholics for a time, their aim being to rule the country.
The only way of escaping these difficulties was a Union of the
Parliaments; but he (Camden) could not undertake to carry it,
still less Catholic Emancipation. Finally he declared the Presbyterians
of Ulster to be Republicans who would rise <span lang="fr">en masse</span>
if the French landed; but if Cornwallis were sent over to lead
the troops, even that crisis might be overcome.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p>Pitt received this letter at the height of the mutiny at the
Nore. He seems to have sent no answer to it: indeed, silence
is the best reply to such an effusion. Camden's letters to Pitt
show that he longed for his recall. In that of 16th November
1796 he concluded with the significant remark that he looked
forward to the time when they would once more live as country
gentlemen in Kent. Pitt had the same longing; but he never
wrote a line expressing a desire to leave the tiller at the height
of the storm. Obviously Camden was weary of his work. Fear
seems to have been the motive which prompted his proclamation
of martial law in several counties and the offer of an amnesty to
all who would surrender their arms before Midsummer 1797.
Those enactments, together with the brutal methods of General
Lake and the soldiery in Ulster and Leinster, crushed revolt for
the present but kindled a flame of resentment which burst forth
a year later. As the danger increased, so did the severities of
the Protestant Yeomanry and Militia. Thus, fear begot rage,
and rage intensified fear and its offspring, violence. The United
Irishmen had their revenge. In the summer of 1797 their two
delegates, Lewins and McNevin, did their utmost to defeat the
efforts of Pitt to bring about peace with France; and the former
had the promise of the Director, Barras, that France would never
sheathe the sword until Ireland was free.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>Again Camden begged Pitt to seek the first opportunity of
freeing him from his duties in order to disentangle his private
affairs which were in much confusion, the excess of expenditure
over income at Dublin being a further cause of embarrassment.
In fact nothing but a sense of public duty, in view of a hostile
invasion, kept him at his post. So far from the truth are those
who, without knowledge of the inner motives of statesmen,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>accuse them of delight in cruelty and of intriguing to provoke
a revolt.</p>

<p>Early in the year 1798 the hopes of malcontents centred in
the naval preparations progressing at Brest and Toulon.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> Bonaparte
also seemed about to deal a blow at London. In February
he surveyed the flotilla at Dunkirk and neighbouring ports;
and the hearts of English Jacobins beat high at the thought of
his landing in Kent or Sussex. The London Corresponding
Society, after a time of suspended animation, had now become
a revolutionary body. On 30th January its new secretaries,
Crossfield and Thomas Evans, issued an encouraging address to
the United Irishmen. Somewhat later Evans and Binns formed
a society, the United Englishmen, which imposed on its members
an oath to learn the use of arms, its constitution in local,
or baronial, committees being modelled on that of the United
Irishmen. A society of United Scotsmen was founded about
the same time; a society of United Britons also came to being,
and issued a fraternal address to the United Irishmen on 5th
January.</p>

<p>Most significant of these effusions is one, dated 6 Pluvi&ocirc;se
An&nbsp;VI [25th January 1798], by "the Secret Committee of England"
to the French Directory, containing the assurance that
Pitt had come to the end of his borrowing powers and that the
people were ready to throw off his yoke. "United as we are," it
concluded, "we now only await with impatience to see the Hero
of Italy and the brave veterans of the great Nation. Myriads
will hail their arrival with shouts of joy: they will soon finish
the glorious campaign." This address was drawn up fourteen
days before Bonaparte set out for Dunkirk. It is clear, then,
that its compilers were not so ignorant as that consequential
tailor, Francis Place, represented them. Their chief mistake lay
in concluding that Bonaparte intended to "leap the ditch." As
we now know, his tour on the northern coast was intended merely
to satisfy the Directors and encourage the English and Irish malcontents
to risk their necks, while he made ready his armada at
Toulon for the Levant.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> Meanwhile the United Britons and
United Irishmen sought to undermine Pitt's Government so that
it might fall with a crash at the advent of the hero of Italy.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>They knew not that the chief efforts of the "soldiers of liberty"
were then being directed to the pillage of Rome and of the cantonal
treasuries of Switzerland in order to provide funds for
Bonaparte's oriental adventure.</p>

<p>Already Irish, English, and French democrats had been fraternizing.
In January 1798 the United Englishmen sent over
two delegates to Dublin to concert action, and about the same
time a priest of Dundalk, named O'Coigly (<span lang="fr">Anglic&eacute;</span> Quigley),
came over from Ireland as a delegate from the United Irishmen
to Evans's Society. Place asserts that his plan of proceeding to
France was not known. But, as Place habitually toned down or
ridiculed the doings of that Society, this is doubtful. Owing to
secret information (probably from Turner, a British spy at Hamburg)
the Government arrested Quigley, Arthur O'Connor, and
Binns, a leading member of the London Corresponding Society,
at Margate as they were about to board a hoy for France (28th
February). A little later Colonel Despard, Bonham, and Evans
were arrested. The evidence against all but Quigley was not
conclusive, and they were released. The case against Quigley
depended on a paper found by a police officer in his pocket,
urging a French invasion of England. He was therefore condemned
for high treason and was hanged on 7th June 1798.
Probably Quigley had that paper from a London Society; but
if so, why were not its officials seized? In some respects the
Quigley affair still remains a mystery. Certainly it added fuel
to the hatred felt for Pitt by British and Irish Jacobins.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p>The evidence against O'Connor was weighty. It was proved
that he was the leader of the party and that he knew Quigley
well. He had a cipher in his possession, which was surely superfluous
if, as he stated, he was travelling on private business.
Probably his acquittal was due to his relationship to Lord
Longueville, an influential Irish peer. Fox, Sheridan, and the
Duke of Norfolk also proceeded to Maidstone to answer for the
virtuous and patriotic character of O'Connor, a fact which
probably led the judge to give a strangely favourable summing-up.
The conduct of the Opposition leaders in this matter led
their former comrade, the Earl of Carlisle, to declare that they
had now sunk to a lower political hell than any yet reached.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>The Government, however, had not done with O'Connor. He
was at once arrested at Maidstone on another charge (22nd
May), and was in prison in Dublin during the rebellion. He
then confessed that he had done more than any one to organize
Leinster for revolt, also that he had had conferences with French
generals with a view to invasion so far back as 1793; and he
stated that he knew the member of the United Irishmen who
in the winter of 1796 advised the French not to come until the
spring of 1797.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> There certainly was some misunderstanding
between the Irish rebels and their would-be helpers; but the
full details are not known. Finally O'Connor was allowed to
retire to France; he became a French general, and helped
Napoleon to concert plans for the invasion of Ireland, assuring
him that, after the work of liberation was done, 200,000 Irishmen
would help him to conquer England.</p>

<p>Meanwhile further news respecting the Franco-Irish plans
reached Pitt through a man named Parish at Hamburg. An
American friend of his at Brussels, while waiting at the municipal
office for passports, saw those of two young Irishmen,
named O'Finn, delegates of the United Irishmen of Cork. They
had a large packet for the Directory at Paris, which contained
the plans of the United Irishmen, the numbers and positions of
the British troops and of the British warships between Dungeness
and the North Foreland. The O'Finns stated this to the
commissary of the Brussels bureau, who heard it with joy. The
American secretly forwarded the news to Parish. The fact that
the O'Finns had a list of the forces on the Kentish coast implied
information from the English malcontents. Accordingly, on
19th April, Government seized the papers of the London Corresponding
Society. They contained nothing of importance
except the constitution of the Society, the oath to learn the use
of arms, and the address to the United Irishmen. The Parliamentary
Committee of Secrecy also believed that a plan was
afoot for bringing to London a band of Irish fanatics to strike a
blow which would paralyse Government while the French landed
and Ireland revolted. This inference seems far-fetched; but the
evidence at hand warranted the suspension of the Habeas Corpus
Act, which Pitt procured from Parliament on the following day.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>Place, with his usual perverse ingenuity, argued that Pitt nursed
the conspiracy in order to be able to create alarm and govern
despotically.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>Events were now moving fast in Ireland. Chief among the
exciting causes were the repressive measures of Camden and
the licence of the Militia and Yeomanry. So able and active
a commander as General Abercromby failed to keep discipline
and prevent military outrages. Not long after his return from
the West Indies he reluctantly accepted these thankless duties
(November 1797). His dislike of the work appears in the following
letter, addressed probably to one of Pitt's colleagues:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Bantry, <i>Jan. 28, 1798</i>.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>... I have found the country everywhere quiet, but there exists
among the gentlemen the greatest despondency: they believe, or affect
to believe, that there is a plot in every family, and a conspiracy in every
parish, and they would abandon the country unless the troops were dispersed
over the face of it for their protection. I believe the lower ranks
heartily hate the gentlemen because they oppress them, and the gentlemen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
hate the peasants because they know they deserve to be hated.
Hitherto rents have been paid, tithes have not been refused or taxes
withheld. No arms or ammunition have anywhere been introduced, and
there are no tumultuous assemblings of the people. I have often heard
of disaffection among the militia; it may perhaps exist among a few
individuals; but it cannot exist to any considerable amount. My inquiries
have been unremitted in this particular. Were, however, a landing
of the enemy to take place, I cannot say what might happen to a
people dissatisfied with their situation and naturally of great levity; the
new doctrines would give activity. We are preparing for whatever may
happen and no labour or exertion shall be wanting.</p>
</div>


<p>Abercromby soon proclaimed his disgust at the excesses of
his troops in unmeasured terms. True, he had much provocation.
The militia officers under him were a loose swaggering
set, whose cruelties to the peasantry during the prolonged
search for arms were unpardonable. Further, their powers had
been enlarged by Camden's order of May 1797, allowing them
to use armed force without the requisition of magistrates, a step
deemed necessary to screen the civil authorities from outrage or
murder. Seeing that officers often put these powers to a brutal
and arbitrary use, exasperating to the peasants and demoralizing
to the soldiery, Abercromby determined publicly to rescind
the viceregal mandate. The language in which he announced
his decision was no less remarkable than the decision itself. On
26th February 1798 he stated in a general order: "That the
frequency of courts-martial, and the many complaints of irregularities
in the conduct of the troops in this kingdom having
too unfortunately proved the army to be in a state of licentiousness
which must render it formidable to everyone but the enemy,
the commander-in-chief" forbids officers ever to use military
force except at the requisition of magistrates.</p>

<p>That the army and militia did not assault their commander
after this outrageous insult shows that their discipline had not
wholly vanished. In face of the vehement outcries of the Irish
loyalists against Abercromby, Camden showed much forbearance.
He issued a guarded statement that Abercromby had been
accustomed to command troops abroad, and did not realize the
impression which would be caused in Ireland by his censure of
the soldiery. Portland, however, openly blamed the commander-in-chief.
Pitt's letter of 13th March to Camden shows that, had
he seen Portland's censure before it went off, he would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
toned down some of its expressions; but on the whole he
heartily disapproved of Abercromby's indiscriminate rebuke to
the army as not only unjust, but calculated to depress its spirits
and encourage those of the French and the Irish malcontents.
Portland's reprimand brought about Abercromby's resignation,
which Camden sought to avert. Thus again events took the worst
possible course. Abercromby was an able and energetic man; and
his resignation, at the time when the arrival of the French was
expected, undoubtedly helped to raise the hopes of malcontents.
Well might Camden write to Pitt on 25th April that Abercromby
had done much harm. With that commander's desire to repress
the outrages of the soldiery everyone must sympathize. The
manner in which he sought to effect it was incredibly foolish.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the work of the conspirators had been undermined
by treachery. One of the conspirators, named Reynolds,
took fright and revealed the secret of the plot to an official at
Dublin Castle (26th February), adding the information that the
Dublin committee would hold a secret meeting on 12th March.
The police, bursting in, seized eighteen members, including
McNevin, along with their papers, amongst which were some incriminating
O'Coigly. Lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped for a
time; but an informer gained knowledge of his movements, and
those of two brothers named Sheares. On his warning the Castle
that they were about to arouse Dublin to revolt, Camden resolved
to anticipate the blow. Two police officers, Swan and
Ryan, tracked Fitzgerald to his lair on the 19th of May. They
found him in bed. At once the fierce spirit of his race surged up.
He sprang at them with the small dagger ready by his side and
struck at Swan. The blow went home, while the pistols aimed
by the officers missed fire. Turning on Ryan, he dealt thrust
upon thrust. The two wounded men clung to him while he
struggled and struck like a wild beast. He was dragging them
towards the door when Major Sirr rushed in and shot him in
the shoulder. Even then his convulsions were so violent that two
or three soldiers, who ran upstairs, scarcely overpowered him.
Swan soon died. The wounds of Ryan were not mortal. That
of Fitzgerald was not deemed serious, but it mortified, and he
passed away on 4th June, mourned by all who knew his chivalrous
daring spirit.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>
<p>The fury of Fitzgerald is intelligible. He was the one necessary
man in the plot then coming to a head for the capture of
Dublin on 23rd May. Among his effects were found a green
uniform, the seal of the Irish Union, the line of route for the
Kildare rebels in their advance, together with a plan for the
seizure of the chief officials. The triumph of the Castle was completed
by the capture of Neilson and the Sheares. Their papers
showed that no quarter was to be given. Irish historians (among
them Plowden) maintained that Pitt and Camden all along knew
of the plot and allowed the conspirators to drive on their mine
in order at the right moment to blow them up. There is no
evidence to this effect, except during the few days preceding the
blow. Camden's efforts were uniformly directed towards disarmament
and coercion, so much so that he is reproached for his
cruelty by the very men who accuse him of playing with the
conspiracy. It is clear that he sought to prevent a rising, which
was expected to coincide with a French invasion. In fact the
only prudent course was to repress and disarm at all possible
points.</p>

<p>The severity of the crisis appears in the letters which Beresford,
Cooke, and Lees, officials at Dublin Castle, wrote to Auckland.
In answer to Lord Moira's reckless charge in the Irish Parliament,
that they were pushing on the country to rebel, Beresford
on 10th April asks Auckland how can they, who are daily exposed
to murder, push on a nation to deeds of violence which
must fall on them? On 1st May he writes: "We think the
Toulon squadron will join the expedition against Ireland....
Pikes are making in numbers, and the idea of a rising prevails.
Kildare and Wicklow are armed, organized, and rebellious.
Dublin and the county are very bad. The rebels expect the
French within a month. Such is their last Gazette." On 7th
May Lees writes to Auckland: "Lord Camden must steel his
heart. Otherwise we are in great jeopardy." On 9th May
Beresford states that it would be a good plan to seize a number
of malcontents, threaten them with flogging and induce them to
turn informers. He adds: "At present the quiet which prevails
in some parts is deceptive. Where the country is organized,
quiet appears. Where the organization is going on there is disturbance.
In Kildare there are complete regiments, with large
quantities of arms in their possession." On 10th May Lees
writes that Galway is arming for revolt, and, nine days later,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
after the arrest of Fitzgerald, he states that they expect a rising
in Dublin on the morrow. On 21st May after the arrest of the
Sheares, Cooke writes: "A rising is not given up; but I think it
will not take place. Parts of Kildare will not give up arms.... A
search for arms will commence. We are in good spirits." On
20th May Beresford informs Auckland of the receipt of news at
the Castle from three different quarters that there would be a
rising on the 21st, owing to the vigorous measures now taken by
the Government.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<p>This is not the language of men who are nursing a plot. It
evinces a resolve to stamp out disaffection before the Brest and
Toulon fleets arrive. As for Pitt, his letters show a conviction of
the need of continuing the repressive measures whereby Camden
had "saved the country." He approved the plan of allowing
officers to act without the orders of magistrates, seeing that the
latter were often murdered for doing their duty. The thinness of
his correspondence with Camden is somewhat surprising until
we remember that his energies mainly went towards strengthening
the army and navy. His letter to Grenville early in June
shows that he expected news of the arrival of the French off the
Irish coast, since they had got out from Toulon on 19th May.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that Ireland was thought to be their goal.
Bonaparte and the Directory had kept the secret of their
Eastern Expedition with far more care than Pitt displayed in
worming it out. Certainly Pitt's spy system was far less efficient
than has been imagined.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> With ordinary activity the oriental
scheme could have been found out from one of Barras' mistresses
or from some official at Toulon. The fact that Bonaparte had
some time previously engaged Arab interpreters might surely
have enlightened an agent of average intelligence. So far back
as 20th April French engineers in uniform, accompanied by
interpreters, had arrived at Alexandria and Aleppo in order to
prepare for the reception of large forces. The interpreters, it is
said, "collect all possible information respecting Suez and the
navigation of the Red Sea, as also particularly whether the
English have any ships in the Persian Gulf. It is supposed that
General Buonaparte will divide his army, one corps to be embarked
from the Red Sea and pass round to the Gulf of Persia,
the other part to proceed from Syria overland to the Euphrates,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>by which river they are to advance and join the remainder near
the mouth of this river; from thence to make, <em>united</em>, the grand
descent on the coast of Malabar or Deccan."<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> In these days it
is difficult to imagine that this news did not reach Pitt until
about 5th July.</p>

<p>The Irish malcontents were as ill informed as Pitt. Basing
their hopes on the arrival of the French fleet, they prepared to
rise about the end of May. But the arrests in Dublin hurried on
their plans. The men of Kildare and Westmeath received orders
from the secret Directory in Dublin to take arms on 23rd May,
on the understanding that the whole of Ireland would revolt.
They were to seize the towns and villages on the roads to
Dublin, while the rebels in the city murdered the authorities
and captured the chief positions. But on the 22nd the Government
seized quantities of arms, and the presence of General
Lake's garrison of 4,000 Yeomen daunted the United Irishmen;
on the night of the 23rd&ndash;24th only the more daring of them
stole about the environs, waiting for a signal which never came;
and by dawn their bands melted away. In Meath also the
rising failed miserably. A large concourse assembled on the
historic slopes of Tara Hill, whence 400 Fencibles and Yeomen
drove them with ease (25th May).</p>

<p>In Kildare and the north of Wicklow, where the influence of
the Fitzgeralds made for revolt, large throngs of men assembled
on the night of 23rd&ndash;24th May, and made desperate attacks
on Naas and Clane, important posts on the roads leading to the
capital. Their headlong rushes broke in vain against the stubborn
stand of the small garrisons. But at a village hard by, named
Prosperous, the rebel leaders fooled the chief of a small detachment
by a story of their intention to deliver up arms. Gaining
access to the village, they surprised the soldiers in the barracks,
girdled them with fire, and spitted them on their pikes as they
jumped forth. That night of horror ended with the murder of
the Protestant manufacturer, whose enterprise had made their
village what it was. A few days later General Ralph Dundas
somewhat indiscreetly granted an armistice to a large body of
Kildare rebels at Kilcullen on the promise that they would give
up their arms and go home. Nevertheless a large body of them
were found on the Curragh and barred the way to General Duff,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>who courageously marched with 600 men to the aid of Dundas.
Duff was informed that these rebels would be willing to lay
down their arms. His men were advancing towards them when
a shot or shots were fired by the rebels, whether in bravado or
in earnest is doubtful. The troops, taking it as another act of
treachery, charged with fury and drove the mass from the plain
with the loss of more than 200 killed. Thus, here again, events
made for animosity and bloodshed. Protestants remembered the
foul play at Prosperous; the rebels swore to avenge the treachery
at the Curragh.</p>

<hr />

<p>News of the first of these events sped across the Irish Sea on
25th and 26th May. They reached Pitt just before or after his
Whitsunday duel on Putney Heath. Thick and fast came the
tales of slaughter. On 29th May Camden wrote in almost
despairing terms&mdash;The rebellion was most formidable and extensive.
It would certainly be followed by a French invasion.
It must be suppressed at once. The Protestants and the military
were mad with fury, and called aloud for a war of extermination.
The strife would be marked by unheard-of atrocities.
For the sake of human nature, Pitt must at once send 5,000
regular troops. Camden added that cavalry were useless against
lines of pikemen, a phrase which tells of the dogged fury of the
peasantry. Nevertheless, his assertion that the rebellion was
extensive proves his lack of balance. The saving facts of the
situation were that the Ulstermen had not yet moved; that Connaught
and Munster were quiet; and of Leinster, only Kildare,
Wexford, and parts of Carlow and Wicklow were in arms. In
Dublin murder was rife, but the pikemen did not muster.</p>

<p>Pitt's reply of 2nd June to Camden is singularly cool. In
brief and businesslike terms he stated that, despite the difficulties
of the situation, he had already prepared to despatch
5,000 men; but Camden must send them back at the earliest
possible moment in order not to disarrange the plans for the
war. Still more frigid was the letter of George&nbsp;III to Pitt. The
King lamented the need of sending troops to Ireland, as they
would thereby be cut off from "active service." Camden (he
wrote) must really not press for them unnecessarily. However,
as the sword was drawn in Ireland, it must not be sheathed
until the rebels submitted unconditionally. Eleven days later
the King wrote to Pitt that the new Lord Lieutenant "must not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
lose the present moment of terror for frightening the supporters
of the Castle into an Union with this country; and no further
indulgences must be granted to Roman Catholics, as no country
can be governed where there is more than one established
religion."<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> The thinness of the King's thought is in part redeemed
by its tenacity. His mind resembled an elemental two-stringed
instrument, which twanged forth two notes&mdash;Church
and State.</p>

<p>In strange contrast to the calculations of the King and Pitt
were the effusions of Camden. On 7th June he referred plaintively
to Portland's despatch, stating that only 3,000 men could
be sent. He warned Pitt that it was a religious war; priests
marched at the head of the rebels, who swept together and
drove at their head the reluctant. For the sake of humanity
Pitt must send larger reinforcements. He added that Lake was
unequal to the emergency. Fortunately, on that day Pitt
received the consent of the Marquis Cornwallis to act as Lord
Lieutenant and Commander-in-Chief in Ireland. As Camden
had more than once pointed out the urgent need of that appointment,
it is surprising to find him on 16th June upbraiding Pitt
with the suddenness of the change. Surely it was no time for
punctiliousness. Already the Ulstermen were rising, and 30,000
rebels were afoot in Wexford. But, as it happened, the worst of
the trouble was over before Cornwallis could take the field.
Landing on 20th June near Dublin, he heard news portending a
speedy decision in Wexford.</p>

<p>It is not easy to account for the savagery of the revolt in that
county. The gentry resided among their tenants on friendly
terms; and the search for arms had been carried out less harshly
than elsewhere. Gordon, the most impartial historian of the
rebellion, admits that the floggings and half-hangings had been
few in number, yet he adds that the people were determined to
revolt, probably from fear that their turn would come. Neither
is the religious bigotry of the rebels intelligible. The Protestants
were numerous in Wexford town, Enniscorthy, and New Ross;
but there seems to have been little religious animosity, except
where tales were circulated as to intended massacres of Catholics
by Orangemen. The Celt is highly susceptible to personal influence;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
and, just as that of the Fitzgeralds largely accounts for
the rising in Kildare, so does the personality of Father John
Murphy explain the riddle of Wexford. The son of a peasant
of that county, he was trained for the priesthood at Bordeaux,
and ardently embraced the principles of the French Revolution
and the aims of United Ireland. His huge frame, ready wit, and
natural shrewdness brought him to the front in Wexford; and
he concerted the plan of establishing an Irish Republic on a
strictly Romanist basis, a programme incompatible with that of
Wolfe Tone and the United Irishmen.</p>

<p>Murphy, marching with his flock to the house of a neighbouring
Protestant clergyman, bade him and his terrified
friends surrender. Meeting with a refusal, they fired the outbuildings;
and when the flames gained the house, they granted
the prayers of the occupants for mercy if they came out. On
coming out the adult males were forthwith butchered. Meeting
with large reinforcements from the hills, Father John's pikemen
beat off a hasty attack by 110 men of the North Cork Militia,
only seven of whom escaped to Wexford. Such were the doings
on that Whitsunday in Wexford (27th May). Next, the rebels
swept down upon Enniscorthy; and though beaten back from
the very heart of the town by the steady valour of the defenders,
these last were yet fain to fall back on Wexford. But for the
plundering habits of the peasantry, not a man could have reached
that town. The priest and his followers now took post on
Vinegar Hill, a height east of the River Slaney, which overlooks
Enniscorthy and the central plain of the county. There on
successive days he and his council dealt out pike-law to some
four or five hundred Protestants and landlords. Meanwhile, as
no help drew nigh, Maxwell, the commander at Wexford,
deeming that town untenable, beat a timely retreat westwards to
Duncannon Fort on Waterford Harbour (30th May).</p>

<p>Master of Wexford county, Murphy and his colleague, Father
Michael, proposed to raise Wicklow and Waterford. If these
efforts succeeded, it was probable that Dublin and Munster
would rise. Ulster might then revolt; and the advent of the
French would clinch the triumph. In full confidence, then, the
masses of pikemen moved against the loyalists at New Ross, an
important position on the River Barrow. Parish by parish, the
priests at their head, they marched, some 30,000 strong. At
dawn of 5th June, when near the town, they knelt during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
celebration of Mass. Then they goaded on herds of cattle to
serve as an irresistible vanguard, and rushed at the old walls.
General Johnstone and the 1,400 defenders were at first overborne
and had to retreat over the bridge; but the plundering
habits of the victors were their ruin. The soldiery re-formed,
regained their cannon, and planting them skilfully, dealt such
havoc among the disorderly mass, that finally it surged out into
the plain.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> After their defeat the rebels deposed Harvey, a Protestant,
from his nominal command.</p>

<p>This success of the loyalists saved Waterford and Kilkenny
from anything more than local riots; and Moore, moving up
from Fermoy and Clonmel, soon threatened the rebel county
from the west. The beaten peasants glutted their revenge on
Protestant prisoners near New Ross; and a general massacre
of prisoners at Wexford was averted only by the rapid advance
of Moore. Meanwhile, Father John, moving into County Wicklow
with a force some 30,000 strong, sought to break down
the defence at Arklow. But that important post on the River
Avoca was stoutly held by General Needham with some 1,500
men, mostly militia and yeomen. There, too, the priests led on
the peasants with a zeal that scorned death. One of the peasant
leaders rushed up to a gun, thrust his cap into it, and shouted,
"Come along, boys; her mouth is stopped." The next moment
he and his men were blown to pieces. Disciplined valour gained
the day (9th June), and John and his crusaders retired to Vinegar
Hill. His colleague, Father Michael Murphy, who had claimed
to be able to catch Protestant bullets, was killed by a cannon-shot;
and this may have decided the rebels to retreat.</p>

<p>The British Guards had now arrived, to the inexpressible
relief of Camden and his advisers. Beset by reports of a general
rising in Ulster and by the furious protests of loyalists against the
inaction of Pitt, the Lord Lieutenant had held on his way, acting
with energy but curbing the policy of vengeance, so that, as he
informed Pitt, he was now the most unpopular man in Ireland.
Nevertheless, before he left her shores, he had the satisfaction to
see his measures crowned with success. The converging moves
of Lake, Needham, Dundas, and Johnstone upon Vinegar Hill
cooped up the rebels on that height; and on 21st June the royal
troops stormed the slopes with little loss. The dupes of Father
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>John no longer believed in his miraculous powers. The survivors
broke away southwards, but then doubled back into the
mountains of Wicklow. The war now became a hunt, varied by
savage reprisals. Father John was hanged on 26th June. By his
barbarities he had ended the dream of United Ireland. Few of
the malcontents of Antrim and Down obeyed the call to arms
of the United Irishmen early in June; and the risings in those
counties soon flickered out. Religious bigotry enabled Dublin
Castle once more to triumph.</p>

<p>Pitt was vehemently blamed by Irish loyalists for his apathy
at the crisis. The accusation, quite natural among men whose
families were in hourly danger, was unjust. As we have seen,
even before the arrival of Camden's request, he took steps to
send off 5,000 men. As the Duke of York and Dundas cut down
that number to 3,000, and endeavoured to prevent any more
being sent, they were responsible for the despatch of an inadequate
force. If the French detachments intended for Ireland
had arrived early in June, they must have carried all before
them. But it was not until 22nd August that General Humbert,
with 1,100 men, landed at Killala. Even so his little force
was believed to be the vanguard of a large army, a fact which
explains the revival of rebellion at the end of the summer.</p>

<p>Not until 1st September did Pitt hear this alarming news. At
once he ordered all possible reinforcements to proceed to Ireland.
There was need of them. The Irish militiamen under
Lake and Hutchinson who opposed the French at Castlebar
rushed away in wild panic from one-fourth of their numbers
(27th August). Such were "the Castlebar Races." Probably the
Irishmen were disaffected; for many of them joined the enemy.
Cornwallis proceeded to the front, and with 11,000 men made
head against the rebels and the French. The latter were now
but 800 strong, and after a most creditable stand finally surrendered
with the honours of war (8th September). Cornwallis
issued a tactful bulletin,<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> commending his troops for their meritorious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
exertions and trusting to their honour not to commit acts
of cruelty against their deluded fellow subjects. In point of
fact 11,000 men with difficulty brought 800 to surrender and
then gave themselves up to retaliation on the rebels. Fortunately
the French Directory sent only small parties of raiders.
A month later, Wolfe Tone, with a squadron, appeared off
Lough Swilly; but the French ships being overpowered by Sir
John Warren, Tone was captured, taken to Dublin, and cut his
throat in order to escape the ignominy of a public hanging.
Another small French squadron entered Killala Bay late in October,
but had to make for the open. Thus flickered out a flame
which threatened to shrivel up British rule in Ireland.</p>

<p>What causes contributed to this result? Certainly not the
activity and resourcefulness of Pitt and his colleagues; for their
conduct at the crisis was weak and tardy. The Duke of York
and Dundas must primarily be blamed for the despatch of inadequate
reinforcements; but Pitt ought to have overruled their
decision. Perhaps the Cabinet believed England to be the objective
of Bonaparte and the fleet at Brest; but, thanks to the
rapid growth of the Volunteer Movement, England was well
prepared to meet an invading force and to quell the efforts of
the malcontent Societies. In Ireland the outlook was far more
gloomy. After the resignation of Abercromby, Camden and the
officials of Dublin Castle were in a state of panic. Pitt did well
finally to send over Cornwallis; but that step came too late to
influence the struggle in Leinster. In truth the saving facts of
the situation were the treachery of informers at Dublin and the
diversion of the efforts of Bonaparte towards the East. The
former event enabled Camden to crush the rising in Dublin; the
latter left thousands of brave Irishmen a prey to the false hopes
which the French leaders had designedly fostered, Barras having
led Wolfe Tone to believe that France would fight on for the
freedom of Ireland. The influence of Bonaparte told more and
more against an expedition to her shores; but the Irish patriots
were left in the dark, for their rising would serve to distract the
energies of England, while Bonaparte won glory in the East. To
save appearances, the French Government sent three small expeditions
in August to October; but they merely prolonged the
agony of a dying cause, and led that deeply wronged people to
ask what might not have happened if the promises showered on
Wolfe Tone had been made good.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>
<p>It is recorded of William of Orange, shortly before his intended
landing in England, that, on hearing of the march of
Louis&nbsp;XIV's formidable army into the Palatinate, he serenely
smiled at his rival's miscalculation. Louis sated his troops with
plunder and lost a crown for James&nbsp;II. Similarly we may imagine
the mental exultation of Pitt on hearing that Bonaparte had gone
the way of Alexander the Great and Mark Antony. Camden
and he knew full well that Ireland was the danger spot of the
British Empire, and that the half of the Toulon force could overthrow
the Protestant ascendancy. Some sense of the magnitude
of the blunder haunted Napoleon at St. Helena; for he confessed
to Las Casas: "If, instead of the expedition to Egypt, I had
undertaken that against Ireland, what could England have done
now?" In a career, illumined by flashes of genius, but wrecked
by strange errors, the miscalculation of the spring of 1798 was
not the least fatal. For of all parts of the British Empire Ireland
was that in which the Sea Power was most helpless when once a
French <span lang="fr">corps d'arm&eacute;e</span> had landed.</p>

<p class="title spaced">THE SECOND COALITION</p>

<p class="quote">To reduce France within her ancient limits is an object of evident and
pressing interest to the future tranquillity and independence of Europe.&mdash;<i>Foreign
Office Despatch of 16th November 1798</i>.</p>


<p>It is difficult to realize that the independence of Europe was
endangered by the French Republic. We associate the
ascendancy of France in Spain, Italy, Germany, Switzerland,
and Holland with the personality of Napoleon; and by contrasting
him with the pygmies who strutted on the stage after
the death of Pitt we find the collapse of Europe intelligible.
But a backward glance of one decade more shows France
dominating the Continent. True, it was Bonaparte's genius
which brought Austria to the humiliating Peace of Campo
Formio (October 1797); but his triumphs in Italy merely crowned
the efforts of France in 1793&ndash;5. After the close of his Italian
campaigns a touch of her little finger unseated the Pope. At
the Congress of Rastatt her envoys disposed of German duchies
and bishoprics in the lordliest way. Switzerland she overran,
plundered, and unified. Ferdinand&nbsp;IV of Naples and his consort,
Maria Carolina, quaked and fumed at her threats. Prussia
was her henchman. And in the first months of his reign Paul&nbsp;I
of Russia courted her favour. French policy controlled Europe
from the Niemen to the Tagus, from the Zuyder Zee to the
Campagna.</p>

<p>Yet this supremacy was in reality unsound. So fitful a ruler
as the Czar Paul was certain to weary of his peaceful mood.
He had good ground for intervention. By the Treaty of
Teschen (1779) Russia became one of the guarantors of the
Germanic System which the French now set at naught. Moreover
his chivalrous instincts, inherited from his mother, Catharine,
were chafed by the news of French depredations in Rome and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
Switzerland. The growth of indignation at St. Petersburg begot
new hopes at Vienna. In truth Francis&nbsp;II, despite his timidity,
could not acquiesce in French ascendancy. How could his motley
States cohere, if from Swabia, Switzerland, and Italy there
dropped on them the corrosive acid of democracy? The appeals
from his father-in-law, Ferdinand of Naples, also had some
weight. In fine the Court of Vienna decided to make overtures
to London. On 17th March 1798 the Chancellor, Thugut,
urged his ambassador, Stahremberg, to find out whether England
would help Austria against "a fierce nation irrevocably
determined on the total subversion of Europe, and rapidly
marching to that end"; also whether Pitt would send a fleet to
the Mediterranean, and, if necessary, prolong the struggle into
the year 1799.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> The entreaties from Naples were still more
urgent.</p>

<p>Pitt resolved to stretch out a helping hand. Early in April
he sought to induce Earl Spencer, First Lord of the Admiralty,
to send to that sea a strong squadron detached from
Earl St. Vincent's force blockading Cadiz. His letter asking for
information on several topics is missing; but Spencer's letter
to Grenville throws so much light on the situation that I quote
parts of it, summarizing the remainder:<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Admiralty, <i>April 6, 1798</i>.</p>

<p>"I send you by Mr. Pitt's desire a sketch I have made out of answers
to the queries he put down upon paper yesterday in Downing Street.
The result is to my mind a decision which I fear will not tally very well
with our wishes and the views you have formed as the groundwork of
the communication at present proposed with Vienna." He then states
that, even if a Russian squadron appears in the North Sea, yet we cannot
keep a permanent squadron in the Mediterranean. "For that purpose
we should at least have 70 sail, as the Channel cannot be trusted with
safety with less than 35, including the coast of Ireland, and the remaining
35 would be but barely enough to watch Cadiz and command the
Mediterranean. Our best plan appears to me to be to maintain as long
as we can a position between Lisbon and Cadiz, and when we are
excluded (which I conclude we soon shall be) from the Tagus, to send
Lord St. Vincent with the fleet he now has to take a sweep round the
Mediterranean and do all the mischief he can to the French navy." If,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>he adds, the Spaniards come northward, our home fleet can deal with
them: if they go to the Mediterranean and join the French there will
not be much danger from so ill-combined a force when opposed to
St. Vincent's fleet, "which I consider as being the best formed to act
together that perhaps ever existed." If Austria would be satisfied with
our sweeping round the Mediterranean, Spencer advocates that plan,
but not that of keeping a fleet there, "because, exclusive of the great
expense, it would leave the Spaniards too much at liberty."</p>

<p>In answer to Pitt's questions Spencer states the force disposable for the
Channel and the coast of Ireland as 34, for the Mediterranean 24; 3 more
were fitting for sea, and 8 others were nearing completion; but the chief
deficiency was in men, 8,000 more being needed. He adds that the
Neapolitans have 4 sail-of-the-line and 7 frigates: the French have 6
sail at Corfu; but he thinks not more than 10 sail can be equipped at
Toulon. He regards the Venetian fleet as valueless.</p>
</div>


<p>Clearly Spencer underrated the force at Toulon and in the
ports of North Italy. But, even so, the position was critical.
To send an undermanned fleet into the Mediterranean, while
France was preparing a blow at Ireland, seemed almost foolhardy.
Nevertheless, Pitt resolved to do so. For, as he stated
to Grenville on 7th April, they must encourage Austria to play
a decisive part in resisting French aggression; and, in view of
the revival of the old English spirit, he was prepared to brave
the risks of invasion, deeming even that event preferable to a
lingering and indecisive war. As usual, Pitt's view prevailed;
and a few days later orders went forth to St. Vincent to despatch
a squadron under Nelson to the Mediterranean, Austria being
also apprised of this decision, in terms which implied the formation
of a league against France. While Russia and, if possible,
Prussia defended Germany, Austria was to expel the French
from Italy.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> Here again Pitt's hopeful nature led him to antedate
the course of events. The new Coalition came about very
slowly. England and Austria were held apart by disputes respecting
the repayment of the last loan, on which Pitt and
Grenville insisted, perhaps with undue rigour. Distrust of Prussia
paralysed the Court of Vienna, and some time elapsed before it
came to terms with Russia. But in the midst of the haggling
came news which brought new vigour to the old monarchies.</p>

<p>On 1st August 1798 Nelson destroyed the French fleet in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>Aboukir Bay; and thus, at one blow, naval supremacy in the
Mediterranean passed from the tricolour to the Union Jack.
This momentous change resulted primarily from the bold resolve
of Pitt to encounter even a French descent on our coasts, provided
that he could strike at France in the Mediterranean. Thus
he exchanged the defensive for the offensive in a way no less
bewildering to the French than reassuring to friendly Powers;
and it is noteworthy that he adopted the same course in 1805,
in sending Craig's expedition into that sea, thereby replacing
Addington's tame acceptance of events by a vigorous policy
which heartened Austria and Naples for the struggle against
Napoleon. On both occasions he ran great risks, but his audacity
proved to be the highest prudence. The results of the
Battle of the Nile were immeasurably great. Bonaparte and his
30,000 veterans were cooped up in Egypt. The Maltese rose
against the French garrison of Valetta two days after the
arrival of the glad tidings from the Nile. At Naples the news
aroused a delirium of joy, and filled Queen Maria Carolina with
a resolve to drive the French force from the Roman States.</p>

<p>To Pitt also the news of Nelson's triumph brought intense
relief. The disappearance of Bonaparte's armada after the
capture of Malta had caused much concern. True, Naples,
which was thought to be his objective, was safe; but Ireland
and Portugal were deemed in jeopardy. No one at Whitehall
anticipated the seizure of Malta and Egypt, still less the
emergence of plans for a French conquest of India. A tone of
anxiety pervades Pitt's letter of 22nd August to his mother:
"The account of Bonaparte's arrival at Alexandria is, I am afraid,
true; but it gives us no particulars, and leaves us in entire
suspense as to Nelson."<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> All the greater, then, was the relief on
2nd October, when tidings of Aboukir at last arrived.</p>

<p>Further, there were signs of a Russo-French war. The romantic
nature of the Czar was fired by the hope of acquiring Malta.
At Ancona, early in 1797, Bonaparte had intercepted a Russian
envoy bearing offers of alliance to the Knights of the Order of
St. John; and their expulsion by the French at Midsummer 1798
seemed to Paul a personal affront. Some of the Knights proceeded
to St. Petersburg and claimed his protection. The affairs of the
Order became his most cherished concern; and on 24th July Sir
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>Charles Whitworth, British ambassador at that Court, reported
that Russia would now become a principal in the war against
France, her aim being the re-establishment of peace on safe and
honourable terms, but not the restoration of the French monarchy,
on which Catharine had insisted. With this declaration
the British and Austrian Cabinets were in full accord; and thus
at last there was a hope of framing a compact Coalition. Fortunate
was it that Bonaparte's seizure of Malta incensed Paul
against France; for, early in August, the Swiss thinker, Laharpe,
tutor of the future Czar Alexander I, brought tempting offers
from Paris, with a view to the partition of the Turkish Empire.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>
That glittering prize was finally to captivate the fancy of Paul;
but for the present he spurned the offer as degrading.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the news of Aboukir did not wholly please him.
For, while rejoicing at the discomfiture of the French atheists,
he saw in Nelson's victory a sign of England's appropriation of
Malta. In truth, that island now became the central knot of
far-reaching complications. Formerly the bulwark of Christendom
against the infidels, it now sundered European States.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> So
doubtful was the attitude of Paul and Francis that Pitt, in
October 1798, twice wrote despondingly as to any definite decision
on their part. All that was clear was their inordinate
appetite for subsidies. These he of course withheld, knowing
full well that neither would Paul tolerate for long the presence
of the French at Malta, nor Francis their occupation of Switzerland.
In any case he resolved not to give more than
&pound;2,000,000 to the two Empires for the year 1799.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> For the
time his hope lay only in the exertions of England, Europe
being meantime "left to its fate." In order to humour the Czar,
who was about to become Grand Master of the Knights of
St. John, Grenville, on 23rd November, wrote to assure his
Government that England renounced all aims of conquest in the
Adriatic, or of the possession of Malta.</p>

<p>At the close of the year Pitt proudly displayed the inexhaustible
resources of Great Britain. His Budget speech of 3rd December
1798 marks an epoch in economic history, alike for the
boldness of the underlying conception and the statesmanlike
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>assessment of the national resources. Well might Mallet du
Pan declare that the speech surpassed all previous efforts in its
illuminating exposition of a nation's finance. As appeared in our
survey of the Budget of 1797, Pitt then sought to meet the
year's expenses within the year. To a generation accustomed to
shift present burdens on to its successors the proposal seemed
Quixotic; and Fox blamed him for not adopting this device.
Pitt held to his plan, and outlined a ten per cent. tax upon income.
Having failed to gain the requisite tenth by means of the
Assessed Taxes, he proposed to raise it by methods which
even the shirkers could with difficulty circumvent.</p>

<p>In order to lay a first rough actuarial basis for his Income
Tax, he made a careful study of the nation's resources in the
autumn of 1798. The results he summarized in an interesting
statement. There were available at that time only rough estimates,
even as to the area of cultivated land and its average
rental. Relying upon Davenant, King, Adam Smith, Arthur
Young, and Middleton, he estimated the area at 40,000,000 acres,
and the average rental at 15<i>s.</i> an acre. He prudently fixed the
taxable value at 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> an acre. The yearly produce of mines,
timber, and canal shares he assessed at &pound;3,000,000. He reckoned
house rent at double that sum, and the earnings of the legal
profession at one half of it. Half a million he deemed well
within the total of doctors' fees. He assessed the incomes
derived from the British West Indies at &pound;4,000,000, and those
from the rest of the world at &pound;1,000,000, a highly suggestive
estimate. Tithes were reckoned at &pound;4,000,000; annuities from
the public funds at &pound;12,000,000; the same sum for profits derived
from foreign commerce; and &pound;28,000,000 for the profits
of internal trade, whether wholesale or retail. Fixing the rental
of land at &pound;6,000,000, he computed the total national income
as &pound;102,000,000, which should therefore yield not less than
&pound;10,000,000 a year. He proposed to safeguard the collection by
imposing an oath at the declaration of income, and enjoining
absolute secrecy on the Crown commissioners. The new tax,
beginning from April 1799, would take the place of the Assessed
Taxes. As will appear in a later chapter, the new impost did
not yield the amount which Pitt expected; but the failure was
probably due to defects in the methods of collection. Pitt further
proposed to set aside &pound;1,200,000 for the Sinking Fund.</p>

<p>His purpose in making this prodigious effort was to inspirit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
other nations to similar patriotic exertions. He pointed out
with pride that after nearly six years of war British exports
and imports exceeded those of any year of peace. Thus, far
from declining in strength and prowess, as croakers averred,
England had never shone so transcendently in the arts of peace
and the exploits of war, a prodigality of power which presaged
the vindication of her own rights and of the liberties of Europe.</p>

<p>What was the new Europe which Pitt sought to call to
being? The question is of deep interest, not only as a psychological
study, but as revealing glimpses of British policy in the
years 1814&ndash;15. The old order having been rudely shaken in
Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Italy, Pitt sought
to effect a compromise between the claims of tradition and those
of expediency. It being of paramount importance to safeguard
Europe against France, Pitt and Grenville insisted on the limitation
of that Power within its old boundaries, and the complete
independence of Switzerland and Holland. That of the Kingdom
of Sardinia afterwards figured in their stipulations. But one significant
change now appears. The restoration of Austrian rule at
Brussels being impracticable, it was suggested that the Belgic
Provinces should go to the Prince of Orange when restored to
his rights at The Hague. In the desperate crisis of 1805, as we
shall see, Pitt sought to allure Prussia by offering Belgium to
her; but that was a passing thought soon given up. The other
solution of the Netherlands Question finally prevailed, thanks to
the efforts of Pitt's pupil, Castlereagh, in 1814. The Foreign
Office did not as yet aim at the retention of the Cape of Good
Hope and Ceylon as a set off to British efforts for the Dutch
and their acquisition of Belgium; but this thought was already
taking shape. The barrier against French aggressions in the
south-east was to be found in the reconstituted Kingdom of
Sardinia, the House of Savoy rendering in that quarter services
similar to the House of Orange in Flanders and Brabant. In
other respects the British Cabinet favoured Austria's plans of
aggrandisement in Italy as enhancing her power in a sphere
which could not arouse the jealousy of Prussia. The aims of
Berlin not being known, except that the restoration of the House
of Orange was desired, Pitt and Grenville remained silent on
that topic.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>
<p>The question whether the peoples concerned would submit to
this under-girding of the European fabric did not trouble them.
They saw only the statics of territories; they had no conception
of the dynamics of nations. A future in which Nationality,
triumphant in Italy and Germany, would bring about a Balance
of Power far more solid than any which their flying buttresses
could assure, was of course entirely hidden from them. But they
failed to read the signs of the times. The last despairing efforts
of the Poles, and the <span lang="fr">lev&eacute;e en masse</span> of the French people, now
systematized in the Conscription Law of 5th September 1798,
did not open their eyes to the future. For they were essentially
men of the Eighteenth Century; and herein lay the chief cause
of their failure against Revolutionary France. They dealt with
lands as with blocks. She infused new energy into peoples.</p>

<hr />

<p>Meanwhile the return of Nelson to the Neapolitan coast
intoxicated that Court with joy. Queen Maria Carolina, ever
the moving spirit at Naples, now laid her plans for the expulsion
of the French from Italy. Trusting to her influence over her
son-in-law, Francis&nbsp;II, and to a defensive compact which the
Courts of Vienna and Naples had framed on 20th May 1798, she
sought to incite him to take the offensive. Her close friendship
with Lady Hamilton, wife of the British ambassador at
Naples, also enabled her to gain complete ascendancy over
Nelson, who, with his usual hatred of "the French villains,"
counselled open and immediate war. For abetting this design,
Sir William Hamilton received a sharp rebuke from Downing
Street. Francis&nbsp;II and Thugut were even more annoyed. They
repulsed the Neapolitan emissary who begged for help, and
roundly accused the Pitt Ministry of inciting Naples to war in
order to drag in Austria. Their anger was not appeased by the
successes of the Neapolitans near Rome, which the French
evacuated on 29th November. The counter-stroke soon fell.
The French, rallying in force, pushed the Bourbon columns
southwards; and the early days of 1799 witnessed in swift
succession the surrender of Naples, the flight of its Court and
the Hamiltons to Palermo on Nelson's fleet, the foundation of
the Parthenopean Republic, and the liquefaction of the blood of
St. Januarius in sign of divine benediction on the new <span lang="fr">r&eacute;gime</span>.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Nelson and the royal fugitives had set in motion
forces which elsewhere made for triumph. Paul, re-assured as
to England's desire to re-establish the Order of St. John at
Malta, entered into an alliance with her on 29th December 1798,
whereby the two Powers agreed to reduce France within her old
boundaries, Russia furnishing to England an army of 45,000
men, mainly with a view to the support of Prussia, on condition
of receiving &pound;75,000 per month and three months' subsidies in
advance. She also promised to send 3,000 men to help in the
siege of the French garrison at Malta and others to assist England
in the defence of the Neapolitan lands. Austria, resentful
towards Pitt and fearful of Prussia's designs, still held back,
though the events in Italy, especially the dethronement of
Charles Emmanuel&nbsp;IV of the House of Savoy by the French
should have spurred her to action. Probably she waited until
the needs of England and Russia should enable her to dictate
her terms. The cupidity of Thugut had been whetted by Pitt's
speech as to the wealth of England; and the efforts of Cobenzl
at St. Petersburg led Whitworth to sign a compact on terms so
onerous to the British Treasury as to draw on him a sharp disclaimer
and reprimand from London.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> So matters dragged on
far into the year 1799, when plans for the ensuing campaign
ought to have been matured.</p>

<p>Still more luckless were the dealings of the British Cabinet with
Prussia. In the hope of winning over Frederick William&nbsp;III,
Grenville in November 1798 despatched his brother Thomas on
a mission to Berlin. His journey thither was one of the longest
and most eventful on record. At Yarmouth he was detained by
easterly gales; and when at last the packet boat made the
mouth of the Elbe it was wrecked. The passengers and crew
succeeded in making their way to shore over the pack-ice,
Grenville saving his papers, except the "full-power" needful for
signing a treaty. He reached Cuxhaven in great exhaustion;
and arrived at Berlin on 17th March, only to find that the French
by daring and intrigue had cowed the North German States
into subservience. The terrible winter of 1798&ndash;9 largely accounts
for the delays which ruined the subsequent campaign. Whitworth
remained long without news from Downing Street; and
at last, on 12th February, announced that he had received nine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>posts at once. Meanwhile France, controlling all the coasts from
Bremen to Genoa, not only excluded British messengers, but
carried on her diplomatic bargaining in Germany without let or
hindrance. For all his trouble, Thomas Grenville could get no
firm footing amidst the shifting sands of Prussian diplomacy.
So nervous were the Austrian Ministers as to Prussia's future
conduct that they seemed about to come to terms with France
and join in the plunder of the smaller German States. This
might have been the upshot had not French armies crossed the
Rhine (1st March 1799), and shortly afterwards invaded the
Grisons Canton.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> Goaded to action, Francis&nbsp;II declared war
eleven days later. On 28th April Austrian hussars seized the
French envoys withdrawing from Rastatt, murdering two of the
four and seizing the papers of all.</p>

<p>Thus began the war of the Second Coalition. Bonaparte's
seizure of Malta and Egypt without a declaration of war, and
the unbearable aggressions of the French in Switzerland, Italy,
and on the Rhine, stirred to action States which the diplomatic
efforts of Pitt and Grenville had left unmoved. For none of the
wars of that period was France so largely responsible. Even
now, when the inroad of the French into Germany threatened
the ascendancy of Prussia, Frederick William declined to join
the Allies; and his unstatesmanlike refusal thwarted the plans
of Pitt for the march of the subsidized Muscovite force through
Prussia for the recovery of Holland.</p>

<p>Another essential point was Switzerland. Like a bastion
frowning over converging valleys, that Alpine tract dominates
the basins of the Po, the Inn, the Upper Rhine, and the Upper
Rhone. He who holds it, if strong and resolute, can determine
the fortunes of North Italy, Eastern France, South Germany, and
the West of the Hapsburg domains. Further, by closing the
passes over the Alps he can derange the commerce of Europe;
and the sturdy mountaineers will either overbear the plain-dwellers,
or will serve as mercenaries in their forces. Accordingly
Switzerland, like her Asiatic counterpart, Afghanistan, has
either controlled her neighbours, or has been fought for by
them. As commerce-controller, provider of troops, and warden
of the passes, she holds a most important position. Fortunate
it is that the Swiss have loved freedom, or money, more than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>dominion. For so soon as a great State possesses their land, the
Balance of Power becomes a fiction.</p>

<p>Pitt evinced sure insight in his resolve to free the Switzers
from the Jacobin yoke. To it the men of the Forest Cantons
succumbed only after desperate struggles, which inspired Wordsworth
with one of the noblest of his sonnets. There is no sign
that Pitt set much store on winning over the public opinion of
Europe by siding with the oppressed against the oppressor, as
his disciple, Canning, did during the Spanish National Rising;
but help from the Swiss was certainly hoped for. So early as
August 1798 Pitt proposed to allot &pound;500,000 for assistance to
them, and, but for the delays at St. Petersburg and Vienna, the
Allies might have rescued that brave people before it fell
beneath the weight of numbers. Even in March 1799, when the
rising against the French had scarcely begun, he set apart
&pound;31,000 per month for the purpose of equipping a corps of 20,000
Swiss. On 15th March, after hearing of the outbreak of war on
the Rhine, Grenville urged that the Russian force subsidized by
England should march towards Switzerland, now that Prussia's
doubtful behaviour prevented a conquest of Holland by land.
He also insisted that this addition to the allied forces destined
for Switzerland must not be allowed to lessen the number of
Austrians operating there.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>The Court of Vienna at once saw in the subsidized Russian
army a tool useful for its own plans, and requested that it should
serve with the Austrians in Swabia. The answer to this singular
request can be imagined. For a day or two Whitworth was also
disturbed by a belated effort of the French Directory to restore
peace. It offered Poland to the Elector of Saxony, and Saxony
to Prussia for her friendly services, Austria being led to expect
Bavaria, if she would keep Russia "within her ancient limits."
Whitworth mentioned this overture to Cobenzl, and saw him
blush for the first time on record.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> Probably, then, the scheme
had some powerful backing; but now Austria had crossed the
Rubicon.</p>

<p>At first all went well. The French had played a game of
bluff which they could not sustain. On all sides they were
worsted in a way which suggests how decisive the campaign
might have been had the Allies heartily seconded the salutary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>plans of Pitt. Unfortunately, despite his efforts, no compact
came about between Great Britain and Austria. Russia and the
Hapsburg State were but loosely connected; and, owing to a
long delay in the arrival of the ratification of the Anglo-Russian
Treaty, Paul did not until the beginning of May send forward
the subsidized army under the command of Korsakoff.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the auxiliary Russian force sent forward
to the help of Austria had by that time helped the white-coats
to win notable triumphs in North Italy. In the months of April
and May, Melas and the Imperialists, powerfully backed by
Suv&oacute;roff's Muscovites, carried all before them, and drove the
enemy from Milan. Soon afterwards the Allies entered Turin;
and only by hard fighting and heavy losses did Moreau with the
chief French army cut his way through to the Genoese coast.
Meanwhile General Macdonald, retiring with a French corps
from Naples, left that city to the vengeance of Nelson and Maria
Carolina with results that are notorious. The French general
made a brave stand in North Italy, only to fall before the onsets
of the Allies at the Trebbia (17th&ndash;19th June). He, too, barely
escaped to Genoa, where the relics of the two French armies
faced about. These successes aroused the highest hopes at
Westminster. Canning, who resigned his Under-Secretaryship
of Foreign Affairs in March 1799, wrote that he cared not
whether the Austrians were beaten; for their failure would serve
as a good example to Europe. But in June, after their brilliant
successes, he expressed a confident hope of the collapse of "the
monstrous fabrick of crimes and cruelties and abominations"
known as French policy; he added that Prussia could not be so
stupid as to hold aloof from the Coalition; and that Pitt, again
vigorous in mind and body, would carry through the war to
the end.</p>

<p>But now in the train of victory there appeared its parasite,
discord. The re-conquest of Italy was so brilliant and easy as
to arouse disputes about the spoils; and when the Imperialists
began to treat Suv&oacute;roff and his heroes cavalierly, the feud
became acute. His complaints to his Sovereign that the Austrians
thwarted him at every turn threw the irascible Czar into a rage,
and he inveighed against the insolence of the Court of Vienna
and its minions. Finally, in order to end these disputes, the
British Ministry proposed the departure of Suv&oacute;roff to Switzerland
in order to take command of Korsakoff's subsidized force.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
In the third week of June Grenville urged this plan on the
Russian Court as securing concentration of force and unity of
command, the result in all probability being the liberation of
Switzerland, whereupon the Allies could prepare for an invasion
of France on her undefended flank, Franche Comt&eacute;. England
(added Grenville) disapproved of the presence of "Louis&nbsp;XVIII"
at the Russian headquarters; and if Monsieur, his brother,
issued a declaration, it must be drafted with care. The need of
caution appears in Monsieur's offer of pardon and clemency to
the misguided French, provided that they joined his standard.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>The Allies, it will be seen, built their hopes on a revolt of the
royalists of the East of France. In fact, widespread risings
were expected. Bordeaux had been the centre of a conspiracy
for leaguing together the malcontents of la Vend&eacute;e with those
of the South, these again being in touch with the royalists of the
Lyonnais and Franche Comt&eacute;. Wickham, who was sent as British
agent to Switzerland in June 1799, opened up an extensive correspondence
which promised to lead to a formidable revolt whenever
the Allies invaded Franche Comt&eacute; and Nice. The malcontents
had as leaders Generals Pr&eacute;cy, Pichegru, and Willot. In
due course the Comte d'Artois ("Monsieur") was to appear and
put himself at their head. Accordingly, in August 1799, he left
Holyrood, came to London, and dined at Grenville's house with
him and Pitt. The Prime Minister afterwards paid him a private
visit: but the details of their conference are not known. It is
certain, however, that the Cabinet accorded large sums of money
to Wickham for use in the East of France. Even after the
failure in Switzerland, he pressed for the payment of &pound;365,000
in order to maintain the royalist movement.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p>Pitt, then, was bent on using all possible means for humbling
France; and, in view of her disasters in the field, the discontent
at home, and the absence of Bonaparte's army in Egypt, the
triumph of the Allies seemed to depend solely on their unanimity.
Much can be said in favour of the British plan of uniting
the two Russian armies in Switzerland to act with that of
the Archduke Charles, in order to strike at Franche Comt&eacute; in
overwhelming force, while the Austrians in Italy invaded Nice.
If all the moves had taken place betimes, formidable forces
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>would have been massed for an attack upon the weakest parts
of the French frontier. The Czar agreed to the plan on 9th
July; but the Emperor Francis withheld his sanction for a
suspiciously long time. Here again, as in 1794&ndash;6, the men of
the pen interfered with the men of the sword. Immersed in
plans for a vast extension of Austria's domains in Italy, Thugut
turned a deaf ear to the demands of Russia and England for the
restoration of the House of Savoy to the throne of Turin. He
declared that, as Austria had recovered the continental domains of
that dynasty, she could therefore dispose of them. It soon appeared
that she sought to appropriate Piedmont, as well as Venetia,
Lombardy, Parma, Modena, and the northern part of the Papal
States in place of her troublesome Belgic domains, thus liberally
fulfilling Pitt's suggestion that her chief gains should be on the
side of Italy.</p>

<p>On this question Pitt and Grenville differed. The latter,
sympathizing with Russia, strongly objected to Austria annexing
Piedmont. Pitt, however, maintained that such an acquisition
would not resemble the partition of Poland or of Venetia;
for Charles Emmanuel had lost his lands through his own weakness,
and now did nothing towards recovering them. Further,
it was to the advantage of Europe that the rescuing Power,
Austria, should hold them as a barrier against France. If the
Czar Paul could not be induced to take this view we might leave
the two Empires to settle the matter; but, at present this solution
offered the best chance of arriving at a compact with Austria
so much to be desired. Thus, in order to strengthen the Barrier
System against France, Pitt was prepared to sacrifice legal rights
to expediency, while Grenville upheld the claims of justice.</p>

<hr />

<p>Limits of space preclude an investigation of the causes of the
humiliating failure of the campaign in Switzerland. Suffice it to
say that, when Korsakoff's army finally entered the north-east
of Switzerland, the Archduke Charles was compelled by imperious
mandates from Vienna to withdraw into Swabia. He
foresaw disaster; and it soon came. While Suv&oacute;roff's army was
toiling down the northern defiles of the St. Gotthard, Mass&eacute;na,
after receiving strong reinforcements, overwhelmed Korsakoff at
Zurich (25th&ndash;26th September). That Pitt expected defeat after
the withdrawal of the Archduke Charles appears from his letter
to Windham:</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Downing Street, <i>30th August 1799</i>.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

<p>I should gladly accept your proposal to join the water-party today,
but I came to town to meet Lord Grenville; and, having seen him, I
am preparing to return part of the way to Walmer in the course of the
evening. I was brought to town by the vexatious accounts from Vienna,
which give too great a chance of our being disappointed in our best
hopes by the blind and perverse selfishness of Austria's counsels.</p>
</div>


<p>Grenville was equally indignant and accused Austria of
treachery.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Much can be said in support of that charge. Whatever
may have been her motive, her conduct ruined the campaign.
South-east of Zurich, Soult routed Hotze's Austrian corps,
which might have linked the movements of Suv&oacute;roff with
those of Korsakoff, and Suv&oacute;roff on arriving at Altorff found
no other course practicable than to strike away eastwards over
the Panixer Pass to Coire in the Grisons. There he arrived after
severe hardships on 8th October, and swore never again to act
with the Austrians. Paul, on hearing these dire tidings, registered
the same vow, and informed the Viennese Court that
thenceforth he separated his interests entirely from hers. Thus
was it that Pitt's plans miscarried. Thus was it that British
subsidies were flung away into the limbo strewn with tokens of
Hapsburg fatuity.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Anglo-Russian effort against the Batavian Republic is
often referred to as if it were the principal event of the year
1799. On the contrary, it was little more than a diversion intended
to help the chief enterprise in Switzerland and Franche
Comt&eacute;. The Czar Paul and Pitt probably did not intend to
hold the Dutch Provinces unless the Allies pressed France hard
on the Swiss frontier and the Orange party rose in force. If
these contingencies held good, then Holland might be held as
far as the River Waal. If not, then the effort must be temporary.
Even so, its advantages were great. The seizure of the Dutch
fleet at the Texel and Helder would end all chance of invasion
from that quarter. Fears of such an attempt had prompted a
counter-stroke dealt by General Coote's force in the spring of
1798 at the sluice-gates near Ostend. Its surrender under untoward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
circumstances was, perhaps, nearly counterbalanced by
the destruction of canal works necessary for the assembly of the
flat-bottomed boats at Ostend.</p>

<p>For a brief space the doubtful attitude of Prussia led Pitt and
Grenville to concert a larger scheme. They hoped to form a
great array of Prussians, Russians, Britons, and Hanoverians
which would sweep the French out of Holland; but obviously
such a plan depended on the support of the Berlin Cabinet. If it
were hostile, or even unfriendly, no force could advance through
Hanover for the delivery of Holland; for it would be at the
mercy of Prussia. In order to bring her into the league, Pitt
and Grenville held out the promise of gains near the Dutch
frontier; but she held coyly aloof, doubtless from a conviction
that Austria would oppose her aggrandisement. So at least
Thugut declared to Eden on his departure from Vienna. Well
might his successor, Lord Minto, remark that the Allies spent
as much time in watching each other's moves as those of the
enemy.</p>

<p>Prussia being immovable, England and Russia laid their plans
for a naval expedition to Holland. By a Convention signed at
midsummer 1799 at St Petersburg, Russia agreed to send a
squadron of 11 ships, convoying an expeditionary force of 17,500
men to the Dutch coast, England paying &pound;44,000 per month for
their services after embarkation. The Czar hoped that England
would send some 6,000 men. The help of 8,000 Swedes was
also expected; but the King of Sweden, annoyed at England's
seizure of Swedish merchantmen, refused all assistance. For a
time Pitt desired both to attack the Island of Voorn below
Rotterdam, and to effect a landing in the estuary of the Ems,
provided that 25,000 British, 18,000 Russians, and 8,000 Swedes
were available. Here, as so often, Pitt's hopes outran the actuality.
Windham believed that he wished to conquer Flanders.
But Windham's moods were so various and perverse that he can
scarcely be trusted. In his view every effort not directed towards
Brittany was wasted; and certainly feints against the coasts of
Brittany and Spain promised to further the Dutch expedition.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>
<p>Early in August Pitt and his colleagues finally resolved to
send the expedition to the Dutch coast; but they had not decided
as to the length or extent of the occupation. So, at least,
it appears from a letter of Pitt to Sir Charles Grey:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Downing Street, <i>Aug. 23, 1799</i>.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></p>

<p>You will not wonder that the circumstances of the present moment
have strongly recalled to Mr. Dundas's mind and mine the conversations
which we have at different times had with you respecting the possibility
of a successful stroke against Brest. The assemblage of the
combined fleets<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> in that port renders such an object more tempting than
ever. We have a prospect, if the expedition in Holland should terminate
speedily, of having a large army of 30,000 men at least, and a large
body of marines, with any number of sail-of-the-line that may be thought
necessary, applicable to such a service by the month of October; and if
the Allies continue to push their operations on the other side of France,
the bulk of the French force will find sufficient occupation at a distance
from their coast. In all these respects the time seems as favourable as
it can ever be expected to be to such an enterprise; and if it is to be
undertaken, we shall derive the greatest confidence of success from seeing
the execution of it placed in your hands. Many circumstances may
undoubtedly arise in the course of the next six weeks which may oblige
us to abandon the idea....</p>
</div>


<p>This letter proves that Pitt did not expect a prolonged occupation
of Holland, at least by British troops; but the notions of
Ministers on this topic were singularly hazy. All things considered,
the expedition at first fared well. Sir Ralph Abercromby,
the leader of the first detachment of some 12,000 British
troops, effected a landing near the forts at the Helder, and on
27th August speedily captured them. Three days later Admiral
Mitchell captured a squadron of 10 sail-of-the-line and several
frigates anchored behind the Texel. Pitt was elated by these
successes, and wrote from Walmer Castle on 5th September:
"We are impatiently waiting till this east wind brings our transports
in sight to carry the remainder of our troops, in order to
compleat speedily what has been so gloriously begun." He adds
that in a short autumn session he hopes speedily to pass by
acclamation a Bill ensuring the doubling of the regular army by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>another levy from the militia.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> Other letters bespeak his anxiety
as to the safety of his brother, the Earl of Chatham, who served
on the Council of War directing the operations of the Duke
of York.</p>

<p>Abercromby's first successes were for a time maintained. At
dawn of 10th September the British force beat off a sharp attack
by Vandamme at the Zuype Canal on the way southwards to
Alkmaar. Three days later the Duke of York arrived and took
the command, including that of a Russian corps under General
Hermann. Moving forwards with some 30,000 men, the Duke
attacked a Franco-Dutch force somewhat inferior in numbers
but very strongly posted at and around the village of Bergen.
The onset failed, mainly owing to the fierce but premature and
disorderly onset of the Russians on the right wing, which ended
in a rout. Abercromby's flanking movement came too late to
restore the fight, which cost the British 1,000 men and the
Russians more than double as many (19th September). Hermann
was taken prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>On 2nd October the Allies compelled the enemy to retreat
from Bergen; but the success was of little service. The defenders,
now strongly reinforced, held several good positions
between Alkmaar and Amsterdam. Meanwhile the Orange
party did not stir. Torrents of rain day after day impaired the
health of the troops and filled the dykes. An advance being
impossible in these circumstances, the Duke of York retreated
to the line of the Zuype (8th to 9th October). There he could
have held his own; but, in view of the disasters in Switzerland,
Ministers decided to evacuate Holland (15th October). Accordingly,
by the Convention of Alkmaar, on the 18th, the Duke of
York agreed to evacuate the Dutch Netherlands by the end
of November, 8,000 of the prisoners of war then in England
being restored. Most questionable was the decision of Ministers
to evacuate the Helder and the Texel. Grenville desired to hold
those posts as bases for a second attempt in 1800; but this was
not done. The only result, then, was the capture of the Dutch
fleet, a prize gained without loss by the end of September.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>
<p>The censures bestowed on this undertaking are very natural.
Success was scarcely possible in the narrow, marshy strip of land
north of Amsterdam. In such a district victory must be costly,
while defeat spelt disaster. The whole enterprise was unwarrantable,
unless the Orange party was about to rise; but on this
subject Ministers were deceived. The Prince of Orange and
his son assured them that it was necessary even to hold back
the loyalists until armed help appeared, so eager were they to
expel the French.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> Not a sign of this eagerness appeared.</p>

<p>Undaunted by this failure, which Sheridan wittily called nibbling
at the French rind, Pitt sought to utilize the Russian force
withdrawn from Holland for the projected blow at Brest. It
was therefore taken to the Channel Islands, greatly to the hurt
of the inhabitants. Pitt and Grenville also concerted plans with
the Austrian Court, which, chastened by the disasters in Switzerland,
now displayed less truculence. It agreed to repay the loan
of May 1797, to restore Piedmont to the House of Savoy, and
to give back to France any provinces conquered in the war, on
condition of the re-establishment of monarchy. Thus, a friendly
understanding was at last arrived at; and on 24th December
1799 Grenville empowered Minto to prepare a treaty, adding
that on the first opportunity the French Government should be
informed of this engagement.</p>

<p>The occasion occurred at once. Bonaparte, having become
master of France by the <span lang="fr">coup d'&eacute;tat</span> of Brumaire (10th November),
wrote on Christmas Day to Francis&nbsp;II and George&nbsp;III
proposing terms of peace. The statesmanlike tone of that offer
has been deservedly admired; but his motives in making it do
not concern us here.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> Suffice it to say that Pitt and Thugut saw
in it a clever device for sundering the Anglo-Austrian compact.
As appears from a letter of Canning, Pitt looked on the new
Consular Government as a make-shift. Writing early in December
to Canning, Pitt stated that the new French constitution
might prove to be of a moderate American kind. To this
Canning answered on the 7th that it might perhaps last long
enough to admit of Bonaparte sending off a courier to London
and receiving the reply if he were kicked back. Or more probably,
France would fall under a military despotism, "of the
actual and manifest instability of which you seem to entertain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>no doubt." In answer to Pitt's statement "that we ought not
to commit ourselves by any declaration that the restoration of
royalty is the <span lang="la">sine qua non</span> condition of peace," Canning advised
him to issue a declaration "that you would treat with a monarchy;
that to the monarchy restored to its rightful owner you would
give not only peace, but peace on the most liberal terms."</p>

<p>Clearly, then, Pitt was less royalist than Canning; but he
decided to repel all overtures from Paris (so he wrote to Dundas
on 31st December), because the condition of France did not
provide a solid security for a peace. He added that he desired
"to express strongly the eagerness with which we should
embrace any opening for general peace whenever such solid
security should be attainable. This may, I think, be so expressed
as to convey to the people of France that the shortest road to
peace is by effecting the restoration of Royalty, and thereby to
increase the chance of that most desirable of all issues to the
war." As Grenville and Dundas concurred in this view, the
Foreign Office sent off a reply stating that the usual diplomatic
forms would be observed; that His Majesty sought only to
maintain the rights of his subjects against a war of aggression;
and that the present time was unsuitable for negotiations
with persons recently placed in power by a Revolution, until
they should disclaim the restless and subversive schemes which
threatened the framework of society. His Majesty, however,
would welcome peace when it could be attained with security,
the best pledge of which would be the restoration of Royalty.</p>

<p>This reply ranks among the greatest mistakes of the time. It
made the name of the Bourbons odious and that of Bonaparte
popular throughout France; and the scornful references to the
First Consul's insecurity must have re-doubled the zeal of
Frenchmen for the erection of a truly national and monarchical
system under his auspices. In truth, it is difficult to see why
Pitt, who held out the olive-branch to the newly-established
Directory in the autumn of 1795, should have repelled the
proffered hand of Bonaparte. The probable explanation is that
he thought more of the effect of the reply at Vienna than at
Paris. On 6th January Grenville forwarded a copy to Minto,
expressing also the hope that it would be regarded as a sign of
the fidelity of England to the Emperor. Further, Pitt's oration on
3rd February 1800 on this topic was marked by extreme acerbity
against Bonaparte. He descanted on his perfidy and rapacity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
at the expense of Venice and the Sultan's dominions, and deprecated
a compact with "this last adventurer in the lottery of
Revolutions.... As a sincere lover of peace," he added, "I
will not sacrifice it by grasping at the shadow, when the reality
is not substantially within my reach. <span lang="la">Cur igitur pacem nolo?
Quia infida est, quia periculosa, quia esse non potest.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> In reply
to a verbal challenge from Tierney a fortnight later, he fired off
an harangue which ranks among the ablest and most fervid of
improvisations. The Whig leader having defied him to state in
one sentence without <em>ifs</em> and <em>buts</em> the object of the war, Pitt
flung back the retort:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>... I know not whether I can do it in one sentence, but in one word
I can tell him that it is security; security against a danger the greatest
that ever threatened the world;&nbsp;... against a danger which has been
resisted by all the nations of Europe, and resisted by none with so much
success as by this nation, because by none has it been resisted so
uniformly and with so much energy.... How or where did the
honourable gentleman discover that the Jacobinism of Robespierre, of
Bar&egrave;re, of the Triumvirate, of the Five Directors, which he acknowledged
to be real, has vanished and disappeared because it has all been
centred and condensed into one man, who was reared and nursed in its
bosom, whose celebrity was gained under its auspices, who was at once
the child and champion of all its atrocities and horrors? Our security in
negotiation is to be this Buonaparte, who is now the sole organ of all
that was formerly dangerous and pestiferous in the Revolution.... <em>If</em>
peace afford no prospect of security; <em>if</em> it threaten all the evils which
we have been struggling to avert; <em>if</em> the prosecution of the war afford
the prospect of attaining complete security; and <em>if</em> it may be prosecuted
with increasing commerce, with increasing means, and with increasing
prosperity, except what may result from the visitations of the seasons;
then I say it is prudent in us not to negotiate at the present moment.
These are my <em>buts</em> and my <em>ifs</em>. This is my plea, and on no other do I
wish to be tried by God and my country.</p>

<p>One who heard that spirited retort left on record the profound
impression which it produced on the House.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>Seeing that Bonaparte was then known merely as an able
<i>condottiere</i>, not as the re-organizer of French society, Pitt's
haughty attitude, though deplorable, is intelligible. The prospects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
of the war were not unfavourable. He hoped that Austria,
now about to invade Nice and Savoy, would be able by her own
efforts to reduce France within her old limits, England's duty
being to offer help on the Riviera, to make a dash at Brest, and
to seize Belleisle as a base of supplies for the Breton royalists,
now once more in revolt. It is significant that Dundas wrote to
Pitt on 4th January expressing his belief that Bonaparte must
be serious in his desire for peace because he had no other game
to play.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>Many influences conspired to mar these hopes. The enterprises
against Brest and Belleisle proved to be impracticable, and
a landing at Quiberon failed because the Breton rising occurred
too soon. The royalists of Provence did not rise at all. An
attempt by Sir James Pulteney and a small force upon Ferrol
was an utter failure. All the operations were paralysed by uncertainty
as to the future conduct of Russia. The indignation of
the Czar against Austria extended to England after the failure
of the joint expedition to Holland; and his testiness increased
owing to maritime disputes and the friction caused by the outrages
of his troops in the Channel Islands. In the Riviera the
Austrians continued their successes, and finally shut up Mass&eacute;na
in Genoa, where the British fleet rendered valuable service.
But it is not surprising to find Grenville writing on 10th April
to Dundas: "For God's sake, for your own honour, and for the
cause in which we are engaged, do not let us, after having by
immense exertions collected a fine army, leave it unemployed,
gaping after messengers from Genoa, Augsburg, and Vienna till
the moment for acting is irrecoverably passed by."</p>

<p>This, however, was the outcome of events. The French, acting
on interior lines, and propelled by the will of Bonaparte, utterly
crushed these sporadic efforts. The Royalists were quelled or
pacified, the coasts were well guarded, while the First Consul,
crossing the Great St. Bernard, overthrew the Austrians at Marengo
(14th June). Before long Naples made peace with the conqueror.
Meanwhile the Sea Power, operating on diverse coasts, delayed,
but did not reverse, the progress of the French arms. British
forces for a time defended Portugal and held Minorca and the
citadel of Messina, but without any appreciable effect on Spain
or Italy. The fleet played an important part in starving out the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>French garrisons of Genoa and Valetta. But elsewhere the
action, or inaction, of the British forces was discreditable. True,
the conditions were adverse, but an army numbering more than
80,000 men, and costing nearly &pound;10,000,000 sterling, should have
accomplished something in Europe.</p>

<p>Only at one point did the British arms win a decisive success.
The French occupation of Egypt had aroused the apprehensions
of Dundas for India; and throughout the year 1800 he continued
to urge an expedition to Egypt, though other Ministers
inclined to put it off. Finally, when Bonaparte's triumph at
Marengo shattered all hopes of an Austrian invasion of Provence,
and the surrender of Valetta, early in September, set free
the British squadron long blockading that port, Dundas pressed
the Egyptian project in a letter to Pitt, dated Wimbledon,
19th September 1800. The gist of it is as follows:<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>On reconsidering the discussion on Egypt at the Cabinet meeting of
yesterday, I am impressed by the danger of delaying action. The importance
of expelling the French from Egypt is obvious; for it is clear
that Bonaparte will subordinate every object to the retention of that
colony. The danger to India may not be immediate, but it must be
faced. Besides, our sacrifice of Turkish interests to those of Austria
[that is, by refusing to ratify the Franco-Turkish Convention of El Arish]
may induce the Sultan to bargain with France on terms very unfavourable
to us. Or, again, France and Russia may plan a partition of the
Ottoman Empire. The objections, that we are pledged to do what we
can for Portugal and Austria, are not vital. For Portugal is safe while
the Viennese Court opposes France; and by our subsidies and naval
help we have borne our fair share in the Coalition. Further efforts in
that direction will be fruitless. We must now see to our own interests.
By occupying all the posts of Egypt, we can coop up the French and
force them to capitulate. Action must not be postponed for any consideration
whatever.</p>
</div>


<p>The opinion of Dundas soon prevailed; for, on 6th October,
Grenville wrote that the Egyptian Expedition was decided on.
As is well known, the joint efforts of forces from England, India,
and the Cape of Good Hope brought about the surrender of the
French garrisons, and the acquisition for the British Museum of
the treasures designed for the Louvre. This brilliant result was in
the last instance due to Abercromby, Hutchinson, Popham, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>their coadjutors. But the enterprise resulted from the untiring
championship of the interests of India by Dundas. Long afterwards
at Perthshire dinner-tables he used to tell with pride how
George&nbsp;III once proposed a toast to the Minister who planned
the expedition to Egypt and in doing so had the courage to
oppose not only his colleagues but his King.</p>

<p>As the year 1800 drew to its close, the opposition of the
Baltic Powers to the British maritime code became most threatening.
The questions at issue are too technical to be discussed
here. Pitt and his colleagues believed the maintenance of the
rights of search and of the seizure of an enemy's goods on
neutral ships to be essential to the existence of England. For
this view of the case much was to be said. In every war France
used neutral ships in order to get supplies; and the neutrals
themselves sought to filch trade from British merchants. Now,
to hinder or destroy the commerce of the enemy, and to prevent
neutrals from bringing naval stores to his ports, were the
only means of bringing pressure from the sea upon the dominant
Land Power. In a strife for life or death Pitt and his colleagues
perforce made use of every weapon, even to the detriment of
non-combatants. This stiff attitude, however, contrasted with
that of Bonaparte, who, in July 1800 flattered the Czar by sending
back Russian prisoners and by offering to cede Malta to him.
Paul, not knowing that the fall of Valetta was imminent, was
duped by this device; and, a few weeks later, occurred the
rupture between Russia and England.</p>

<p>Thus, within a year, the Second Coalition against France
went to pieces, and was succeeded by a league against England.
Thanks to the victory of Nelson at Copenhagen and the murder
of the Czar Paul in the spring of 1801, that unnatural alliance
speedily collapsed. These events, however, belong to a time
subsequent to Pitt's resignation of office, after the completion of
the union with Ireland, to which we must now return. Enough
has been said to show the statesmanlike nature of his plans for
the vindication of European independence. The intrigues of
Thugut, the selfish isolation of Prussia, and the mad oscillations
of Paul marred those plans and left the Continent a prey to the
unbridled ambition of Bonaparte, from which it was to be saved
only after a decade of exhausting wars.</p>

<p class="title spaced">THE UNION</p>

<p class="quote">I am determined not to submit to the insertion of any clause that shall
make the exclusion of the Catholics a fundamental part of the Union, as I
am fully convinced that, until the Catholics are admitted into a general
participation of rights (which, when incorporated with the British Government,
they cannot abuse) there will be no peace or safety in Ireland.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cornwallis
to Ross</span>, <i>30th September 1798</i>.</p>


<p>The fairest method of dealing with the Act of Union of the
British and Irish Parliaments seems to be, firstly, to trace
the development of Pitt's thoughts on that subject; secondly, to
survey the state of affairs in Ireland after the Rebellion of 1798;
and thirdly, to trace the course of the negotiations whereby the
new Lord Lieutenant, Cornwallis, succeeded in carrying through
the measure itself.</p>

<p>Firstly, it is clear that Pitt had long felt the need of closer
commercial ties between the two islands. As was shown in
Chapter&nbsp;XI of the former part of this work, he sought to prepare
the way for such a measure in the session of 1785. The importance
which he attached to the freeing of inter-insular trade
appears in a phrase of his letter of 6th January 1785 to the
Duke of Rutland as to Great Britain and Ireland becoming
"one country in effect, though for local concerns under distinct
legislatures," This represents his first thoughts on the subject.
Obviously they were then limited to a commercial union. If the
two Parliaments and the two nations could have shaken off their
commercial jealousies, Pitt would probably have been satisfied
with fostering the prosperity of both islands, while leaving their
legislative machinery intact. But, being thwarted by the stupidity
of British traders and the nagging tactics adopted at Dublin, he
wrote to Rutland that his plan was not discredited by failure and
they must "await times and seasons for carrying it into effect."</p>

<p>Times and seasons brought, not peace and quiet, but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
French Revolution. With it there came an increase of racial
and religious feuds, which, however, did but strengthen his conviction
of the need of a closer connection between the two
islands; witness his letter of 18th November 1792 to the Lord
Lieutenant, the Earl of Westmorland:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>The idea of the present fermentation gradually bringing both parties
to think of an Union with this country has long been in my mind. I
hardly dare flatter myself with the hope of its taking place; but I believe
it, tho' itself not easy to be accomplished, to be the only solution for
other and greater difficulties. The admission of Catholics to a share of
suffrage could not then be dangerous. The Protestant interest, in point
of power, property and Church Establishment, would be secure because
the decided majority of the supreme Legislature would necessarily be
Protestant; and the great ground of argument on the part of the
Catholics would be done away, as, compared with the rest of the Empire,
they would become a minority. You will judge when and to whom this
idea can be confided. It must certainly require great delicacy and
management; but I am heartily glad that it is at least in your thoughts.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>
</div>


<p>These words show why Pitt allowed proposals so imperfect
as the Franchise Bill of 1793 to become law. It enfranchised
most of the Irish peasantry, the great majority of whom were
Catholics, though men of their creed were excluded from Parliament.
But he hoped in the future to supplement it by a far
greater measure which would render the admission of Catholics
to Parliament innocuous, namely, by the formation of a united
Parliament in which they would command only a small minority
of votes. Pitt's words open up a vista which receded far away
amidst the smoke of war and the mirage of bigotry, and did not
come into sight until the second decade of the period of peace,
when Canning, Pitt's disciple, was the chief champion of the
measure here first clearly outlined. Pitt, then, desired a Union
as the sole means of ending commercial disputes, otherwise as
insoluble as those between England and Scotland previous to
the year 1707; but also for an even weightier reason, because
only so could the religious discords of Irishmen be ended; only
so could the chafing of the majority against the rule of a cramping
caste cease. By the formation of an Imperial Parliament,
the Irish Protestants would have solid guarantees against the
subversion of all that they held most dear.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>
<p>The full realization of these aims was impossible. Early in
1793 came war with France, with its sequel, the heating of
nationalist and religious feeling in Ireland; and while the officials
of Dublin Castle embarked on a policy of repression, the United
Irishmen looked for help to Paris. The results appeared in the
Rebellion of 1798. The oft-repeated assertion that Pitt and
Camden brought about the revolt in order to force on the Union
is at variance with all the available evidence. They sought by all
possible means to prevent a rising, which, with a reasonable
amount of help from France, must have shaken the British
Empire to its base. When the rebellion came and developed
into a bloody religious feud, they saw that the time for a Union
had come.</p>

<p>The best means of checking hasty generalizations is to peruse
letters written at the time, before ingenious theories could be spun.
Now, the definite proposal of a Union very rarely occurs before
the month of June 1798. One of the first references is in a letter
of the Lord Chancellor, Loughborough, to Pitt, dated 13th June
1798. After approving the appointment of Cornwallis as the best
means of quelling the revolt in Ireland, he adds: "Every reasonable
man in that country must feel that their preservation depends
on their connection with England, and it ought [to] be their first
wish to make it more entire. It would be very rash to make any
such suggestion from hence: but we should be prepared to
receive it and to impose the idea whenever it begins to appear in
Ireland."<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p>More important, as showing the impossibility of continuing
the present chaotic administration at Dublin, is the following
letter from the Earl of Carlisle, formerly Lord Lieutenant, to
Pitt. It is undated, but probably belongs to 2nd June 1798:<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>... It may perhaps be but a weak apology for this interruption to
own I cannot help looking at that country [Ireland] with a sort of affection,
like an old house which one has once inhabited, not disliking the
antient arrangement of its interior, and perhaps unreasonably prejudiced
against many of its modern innovations. The innovation that has long
given me uneasiness, and which now seems most seriously to perplex
the Irish Government, was the fatal institution of an Irish Cabinet, which
has worked itself into being, considered almost as a component part of
that deputed authority. A Government composed of Lords Justices,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>natives of that country, as a permanent establishment, absurd as such
an expedient might be, would not have at least that radical defect of
authority disjoined from responsibility. We now feel all the bad effects
of a power which should never have been confer'd, and which is strengthen'd
from hence by many acting with you, so as to make it impossible
for the Lord Lieutenant to manage with it or without it.</p>

<p>You have, in my poor judgment, an opportunity offer'd to crush at
one blow this defective system. Ireland, I scruple not to say, cannot be
saved if you permit an hour longer almost the military defence of that
country to depend upon the tactical dictates of Chancellors, Speaker of
the House of Commons, etc. I mean to speak with no disrespect of Lord
Camden; I never heard anything but to his honour; but I maintain
under the present circumstances the best soldier would make the best
Lord-Lieutenant; one on whom no Junto there would presume to fling
their shackles, and one who would cut them short if they presumed to
talk of what they did not understand. With this idea, I confess, L<sup>d</sup>
Cornwallis naturally occurs to me. Next to this, but not so efficacious,
would be sending some one equal to the military duties, freed from all
control, saving that, for form's sake, good sense would acquiesce under
to [<span lang="la">sic</span>] the King's Deputy. But I cannot doubt but a deeper change
would be most advisable. The disaffected to our Government (and I
fear it is too general) may perhaps have their degrees and divisions of
animosity against it, and some possibly may be changed by a change of
men more than by a professed change of measures, which perhaps they
think little about. I know they are taught to believe a particular set of
men are their enemies; in truth I question if, in tyrannising over and
thwarting the Castle, and talking so injudiciously, they ought to be considered
as our friends....</p>
</div>


<p>Thus the man to whom in 1795 Earl Fitzwilliam poured
forth his grievances against Pitt, now advised him to end the
mischievous dualism at Dublin, which enabled Lords Justices
and the Speaker of the Irish House of Commons to paralyse
the Executive. There, as at Berlin, advisers who had great
influence but no official responsibility, often intervened with
disastrous results; and not until Stein took the tiller after Tilsit did
the Prussian ship of State pursue a straight course. At Dublin
the crisis of 1798 revealed the weakness of the Irish Executive,
and naturally led to a complete break with the past.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>Amidst the mass of Pitt's papers relating to Ireland there is
no sign of his intention to press on an Act of Union before the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>middle of the month of June 1798, that is, in the midst of the
Rebellion. The first reference to it occurs in a memorandum endorsed
by Pitt "received June 19, 1798," and obviously drawn
up by Camden a few days before he resigned the Viceroyalty in
favour of Cornwallis. Pitt's letter of inquiry is missing. Camden's
reply is too long for quotation, but may be thus summarized:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>The plan of a Union should be detailed as far as possible before it is
attempted. The King's Cabinet should be at once consulted, also leading
persons in both islands. If their opinion is favourable, the measure
should then be brought forward. If the Catholic claims are to be met,
the advice of their leading men, as for instance Lords Fingal and
Kenmare, should be sought. The legal attainments of the Irish Chancellor,
the Earl of Clare, and the parliamentary and commercial connections
of the Speaker, Foster, entitle their opinions to great weight.
Foster may perhaps be won over by the offer of an English peerage.
The Irish Bar, as also Lords Shannon and Ely, will probably oppose a
Union. Some persons will object to the admission of Catholics even to
the United Parliament, though that measure cannot do harm. The
Scottish Catholics should have the same privileges accorded to them,
and a provision should be made for the Dissenting clergy. Parliamentary
Reform must be considered, but it will not be dangerous now. The French
will never make peace until Great Britain is weakened. The religious
difficulty of a Union will not be great, for the Protestants will always form
the majority in the United Parliament. Legal expenses in the case of
Irish suits will be little more than in Scottish suits. As Dublin will
suffer from the removal of the Parliament, the Lord Lieutenant's Court
must be kept up in great splendour, the residence of influential persons
in Ireland being encouraged in every possible way. The communications
between the two islands must be improved, free packet-boats being
provided. In a postscript Camden adds that he hopes Cornwallis will
continue the present repressive policy, which otherwise must appear
unduly harsh by contrast.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>
</div>


<p>The most significant passages are those in which Camden
refers to the plan of a Union as so unformed as to require preliminary
inquiries, and in which he presumes that after the
Union Dissenters and Catholics will have "the same advantages
as are bestowed upon the rest of the inhabitants of the three kingdoms."
Clearly, then, Pitt and Camden had come to no decision
on the Union; but Camden, from what he knew of Pitt's views,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>believed that he favoured a broad and inclusive policy, not a
Union framed on a narrowly Protestant basis. Neither of them
seems to have anticipated serious resistance on the religious
question, even though the King, at the time of the Fitzwilliam
crisis of 1795, had declared the admission of Catholics to the
Irish Parliament to be a matter which concerned his conscience,
not his Cabinet.</p>

<p>It is also obvious that the question of the Union was forced
to the front by the cumbrous dualism of the Irish Executive,
which proved to be utterly unable to cope with the crisis of the
Rebellion. The King, as we have seen, shrewdly suggested that
Cornwallis ought to make use of the fears of Irish loyalists in
order to frighten the Dublin Parliament into acquiescence in an
Act of Union. The same opinion was gaining ground; but
several of Pitt's supporters doubted the advisability of so far-reaching
a measure. Thus, on 4th July 1798, Hatsell, Clerk of
the House of Commons, wrote to Auckland that of all possible
plans a Union was the worst, "full of difficulties, to be brought
about by errant jobs; and, when done, not answering the purpose.
You must take out the teeth, or give the Catholics sops to
eat. One or other; but the half-measure won't do." Better
balanced was the judgement of the Earl of Carlisle, as stated to
Auckland some time in September. After asking whether the
recurrence of local risings in Ireland did not prove the unwisdom
of the policy of lenience pursued by Cornwallis, he
added these significant words: "In this distress it is not strange
that we should turn to the expedient of Union; but this is running
in a dark night for a port we are little acquainted with....
If you did not satisfy Ireland by the measure and take off some
part of those ill-disposed to England, you would only make
matters worse. But in truth something must be done, or we
must fight for Ireland once a week."<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

<p>That the activity of the rebels varied according to the prospects
of aid from France was manifest. Thus, on 25th July
Beresford wrote to Auckland that the people seemed tired of
rebellion, which would die out unless the French landed. But
on 22nd August, after the arrival of Humbert's little force in
Killala Bay, he described the whole country as in revolt. The
State prisoners, O'Connor, McNevin, and Addis Emmett, sent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>to the papers a denial of their former pacific assurances;<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> and
even after the surrender of Humbert's force, Beresford wrote to
Auckland on 15th September: "... Should the French or the
Dutch get out an armament and land, there will be a very general
rising. I have it from a man on whose veracity I can depend,
and who was on the spot in Mayo, during the French invasion,
that the Catholics of the country ran to join them with eagerness,
and that they had more than they could arm; that, as they
moved on, they were constantly joined; but he says the Irish behaved
so ill that the French made use of discipline, which thinned
their ranks; however, they had 4,000 of them when they were attacked
by Colonel Vereker, and about 200 of the Limerick militia.
By our late accounts there are said to be in Mayo and Roscommon
10,000 rebels up: they are destroying the country."<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>
Beresford then blames the Viceroy's proclamation, offering pardon
to rebels who come in within a month, and he says their leaders
tell them that 20,000 French will soon land. Equally significant
is the statement of George Rose in a letter of 23rd September.
Referring to the fact that two French warships had got away
from Brest towards the Irish coast, he writes: "If they land,
the struggle may be more serious. The truth is that it will be
nearly impossible to keep Ireland as a conquered country.
Union is become more urgent than ever." This was also the
opinion of Lord Sheffield. Writing on 29th September from
Rottingdean to Auckland, he remarks on the disquieting ease
with which the French squadrons reach Ireland. He has had a
long argument with the Irish Judge, Sir William Downes, and
proved to him the necessity of a Union with Ireland. But (he
proceeds) it will never take place, if it is set about publicly.</p>

<p>Irish loyalists united in decrying the comparatively lenient
methods of Cornwallis; but, despite the urgent advice of Camden
to Pitt, the change of system met with approval at Downing Street.
This is the more remarkable as letters from Dublin were full of
invectives against Cornwallis. Buckingham wrote almost daily
to his brother, Grenville, foretelling ruin from the weakness and
vacillation of the Lord Lieutenant. Still more furious were
Beresford, Cooke, and Lees. Their correspondence with Auckland,
Postmaster-General at London, was so systematic as to
imply design. Probably they sought to procure the dismissal of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>Cornwallis and the nomination of Auckland in his place. There
can be little doubt that Auckland lent himself to the scheme
with a view to maintaining the Protestant ascendancy unimpaired;
for he wrote to Beresford that public opinion in England
favoured the maintenance of the existing order of things in
Church and State in both kingdoms. The following extracts
from the letters which he received from Cooke and Lees are
typical. On 4th October Lees writes: "I am afraid Lord Cornwallis
is not devil enough to deal with the devils he has to contend
with in this country.... The profligacy of the murderous
malignant disposition of Paddy soars too high for his humane
and merciful principles at this crisis." Cooke was less flowery
but equally emphatic: "If," he wrote on 22nd October, "your
Union is to be Protestant, we have 100,000 Protestants who are
connected by Orange Lodges, and they might be made a great
instrument.... Our robberies and murders continue; and the
depredations of the mountain rebels increase."<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless Cornwallis held on his way. In the period 22nd
August 1798 to the end of February 1799, he reprieved as many
as 41 rebels out of 131 on whom sentence of death had been
passed, and he commuted to banishment heavy sentences passed
on 78 others. It is clear, then, that, despite the efforts of Buckingham
and the officials of Dublin Castle, Pitt continued to uphold
a policy of clemency. But it is equally clear that the reliance
of Irish malcontents on French aid, the persistent efforts of the
Brest squadron to send that aid, and the savage reprisals demanded,
and when possible enforced, by the loyal minority of
Irishmen, brought about a situation in which Ireland could not
stand alone.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>Preliminary inquiries respecting the Act of Union were set
on foot, and the results were summarized in Memoranda of the
summer and autumn of 1798. One of them, comprised among
the Pelham manuscripts, is annotated by Pitt. The compiler thus
referred to the question of Catholic Emancipation: "Catholics to
be eligible to all offices, civil and military, taking the present
oath. Such as shall take the Oath of Supremacy in the Bill of
Rights may sit in Parliament without subscribing the Abjuration.
Corporation offices to be Protestant." On this Pitt wrote
the following note: "The first part seems unexceptionable, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>is exactly what I wish&nbsp;... but if this oath is sufficient for office,
why require a different one for Parliament? And why are Corporation
offices to be exclusively Protestant, when those of the
State may be Catholic?"<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> Well might Pitt ask these questions,
for the whole system of exclusion by religious tests was condemned
so soon as admission to Parliament ceased to depend
on them. Other Memoranda dealt mainly with the difficult
question of compensation to the borough-holders and placemen
who would suffer by the proposed change. But for the present
it will be well to deal with the question of the abolition of
religious tests.</p>

<p>The procedure of Pitt in regard to this difficult subject was
eminently cautious. As was the case before dealing with the
fiscal problem in 1785, so now he invited over certain leading
Irishmen in order to discuss details. About the middle of
October he had two interviews with the Earl of Clare, Lord
Chancellor of Ireland. These important conferences took place
at Holwood, where he was then occupied in marking out a new
road; for his pastime every autumn was to indulge his favourite
pursuit of planting trees and otherwise improving his grounds.
The two ablest men in the sister kingdoms must have regarded
one another with interest. They were not unlike in figure except
that Clare was short. His frame was as slight as Pitt's;
his features were thin and finely chiselled. Neither frame nor
features bespoke the haughty spirit and dauntless will that
enabled him at times to turn the current of events and overbear
the decisions of Lords Lieutenant. In forcefulness and narrowness,
in bravery and bigotry, he was a fit spokesman of the British
garrison, which was resolved to hold every outwork of the citadel.</p>

<p>The particulars of their converse are unknown. Probably
Clare had the advantage which a man of narrow views but
expert knowledge enjoys over an antagonist who trusts in lofty
principles and cherishes generous hopes. Clare, knowing his
ground thoroughly, must have triumphed. Pitt did not confess
his defeat. Indeed, on 16th October, he wrote reassuringly to
Grenville: "I have had two very full conversations with Lord
Clare. What he says is very encouraging to the great question
of the Union, in which I do not think we shall have much
difficulty; I mean, in proportion to the magnitude of the subject.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>At his desire I have written to press the Speaker [Foster] to
come over, which he seems to think may be of great importance."
Here is Clare's version of the interviews in a letter of the
same day to his fellow countryman, Castlereagh: "I have seen
Mr. Pitt, the Chancellor, and the Duke of Portland, who seem
to feel very sensibly the critical situation of our damnable
country, and that the Union alone can save it. I should have
hoped that what has passed would have opened the eyes of
every man in England to the insanity of their past conduct
with respect to the Papists of Ireland; but I can very plainly
perceive that they were as full of their popish projects as ever.
I trust, and I hope I am not deceived, that they are fairly inclined
to give them up, and to bring the measure forward unencumbered
with the doctrine of Emancipation. Lord Cornwallis
has intimated his acquiescence in this point; Mr. Pitt is decided
upon it, and I think he will keep his colleagues steady."<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>The mention of Castlereagh seems to call for a short account
of one who, after assisting in carrying the Act of Union, was
destined to win a European reputation as a disciple of Pitt.
Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, and second Marquis of
Londonderry (1769&ndash;1822), was the son of Robert Stewart of
Ballylawn in County Londonderry by his first marriage, that
with the daughter of the Earl of Hertford. Educated at Armagh
and at St. John's College, Cambridge, he soon returned to contest
the seat of County Down with Lord Downshire, and
succeeded by dint of hard work and the expenditure of &pound;60,000.
He entered the Irish Parliament as a representative of the freeholders
as against the aristocracy; but the second marriage of
his father (now Marquis of Londonderry) with the eldest daughter
of the late Earl Camden brought the family into close connection
with the second Earl, who, on becoming Lord Lieutenant in
1795, soon succeeded in detaching young Stewart from the
popular party, already, from its many indiscretions, distasteful
to his cool and cautious nature. Stewart had recently married
Lady Emily Hobart, the daughter of the late Earl of Buckinghamshire,
and became Viscount Castlereagh in October 1795.
Though continuing to support the claims of the Catholics, he
upheld Camden's policy of coercion; and his firm and resolute
character made his support valuable in Parliament.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>
<p>The sagacity of his advice in committee, and the straightforward
boldness of his action as an administrator, are in marked
contrast to his rambling and laboured speeches, in whose incongruous
phrases alone there lurked signs of Hibernian humour.
"The features of the clause"; "sets of circumstances coming up
and circumstances going down"; "men turning their backs upon
themselves"; "the constitutional principle wound up in the
bowels of the monarchy"; "the Herculean labour of the honourable
member, who will find himself quite disappointed when
he has at last brought forth his Hercules"&mdash;such are a few of
the rhetorical gems which occasionally sparkled in the dull
quartz of his plentiful output. Nevertheless, so manly was his
bearing, so dogged his defence, that he always gained a respectful
hearing; and supporters of the Government plucked up
heart when, after a display of dazzling rhetoric by Grattan or
Plunket, the young aristocrat drew up his tall figure, squared
his chest, flung open his coat, and plunged into the unequal
contest. Courage and tenacity win their reward; and in these
qualities Castlereagh had no superior. It is said that on one
occasion he determined to end a fight between two mastiffs,
and, though badly bitten, he effected his purpose. These virile
powers marked him out for promotion; and during the illness
of Pelham, Chief Secretary at Dublin, Castlereagh discharged
his duties. Cornwallis urged that he should have the appointment;
and to the King's initial objection that a Briton ought
to hold it, Cornwallis successfully replied that Castlereagh was
"so very unlike an Irishman" that the office would be safe in
his hands. Castlereagh received the appointment early in November
1798. He, the first Irishman to hold it, was destined to
overthrow the Irish Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

<p>We must now revert to the negotiations between Pitt and
Clare. It is surprising to find Clare convinced that the
Prime Minister would keep faithful to the Protestant cause its
unfaithful champion, Loughborough, also that Cornwallis had
acquiesced in the shelving of Catholic Emancipation. Probably
Clare had the faculty, not uncommon in strong-willed
men, of reading his thoughts into the words of others. For
Cornwallis, writing to Pitt on 8th October, just after saying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span><span class="ins" title="arewell">farewell</span> to Clare at Dublin, describes him as a well-intentioned
man, but blind to the absolute dependence of Irish Protestants
on British support and resolutely opposed to the admission of
Romanists to the united Parliament. As to himself, Cornwallis
pens these noble words: "I certainly wish that England could
now make a Union with the Irish nation, instead of making it
with a party in Ireland"; and he expresses the hope that with fair
treatment the Roman Catholics will soon become loyal subjects.
Writing to the Duke of Portland in the same sense, Cornwallis
shows a slight diffidence in his ability to judge of the chief
question at issue.</p>

<p>Probably the solution of the riddle is here to be found. It
seems that the Lord Lieutenant was politely deferential to
Clare; that at Holwood Clare represented him as a convert to
the ultra-Protestant tenets; and that Pitt accepted the statements
of the Irish Chancellor. William Elliot, Under-Secretary at War
at Dublin, who saw Pitt a week later, found him disinclined to
further the Catholic claims at the present juncture, though equally
resolved not to bar the way for the future. Possibly the King
now intervened. It is a significant fact that Clare expected to
have an interview with him before returning to Ireland. If so,
he must have strengthened his earlier resolve. Pitt, then, gave
way on the question of the admission of Dissenters and Catholics
to the Irish Parliament. But he kept open the more important
question of the admission of Catholics to the United Parliament.
Obviously, the latter comprised the former; and it was likely to
arouse the fears of the Irish Protestants far less. On tactical
grounds alone the change of procedure was desirable. It is
therefore difficult to see why Elliot so deeply deplored his
surrender to the ultra-Protestants. Pitt had the approval of
Grenville, who, owing to the religious feuds embittered by the
Rebellion, deprecated the imposition of the Catholic claims on
the fiercely Protestant Assembly at Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> Yet he warmly supported
them in the United Parliament, both in 1801 and 1807.</p>

<p>The next of the Protestant champions whom Pitt saw was
Foster, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, whose forceful
will, narrow but resolute religious beliefs, and mercantile connections
gave him an influence second only to that of Clare. In
the course of a long conversation with him about 15th November,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
Pitt found him frank in his opinions, decidedly opposed to
the Union, but not so fixedly as to preclude all hope of arrangement.
On this topic Pitt dilated in a "private" letter of 17th
November, to Cornwallis:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>... I think I may venture to say that he [Foster] will not obstruct
the measure; and I rather hope if it can be made palatable to him personally
(which I believe it may) that he will give it fair support. It
would, as it seems to me, be worth while for this purpose, to hold out
to him the prospect of a British peerage, with (if possible) some ostensible
situation, and a provision for life to which he would be naturally entitled
on quitting the Chair. Beresford and Parnell do not say much on
the general measure, but I think both, or at least the former against
trying it, but both disposed to concur when they understand it is finally
resolved on. They all seem clearly (and I believe sincerely) of opinion
that it will not be wise to announce it as a decided measure from
authority, till time has been given for communication to all leading individuals
and for disposing the public mind. On this account we have
omitted all reference to the subject in the King's Speech; and the communication
may in all respects be more conveniently made by a separate
message when the Irish Parliament is sitting, and it can be announced
to them at the same time. In the interval previous to your Session there
will, I trust, be full opportunity for communication and arrangement
with individuals, on which I am inclined to believe the success of the
measure will wholly depend. You will observe that in what relates to
the oaths to be taken by members of the United Parliament, the plan
which we have sent copies the precedent I mentioned in a former
letter of the Scotch Union; and on the grounds I before mentioned, I
own I think this leaves the Catholic Question on the only footing on
which it can safely be placed. Mr. Elliott when he brought me your
letter, stated very strongly all the arguments which he thought ought to
induce us to admit the Catholics to Parliament, and office; but I confess
he did not satisfy me of the practicability of such a measure at this
time, or of the propriety of attempting it. With respect to a provision
for the Catholic clergy, and some arrangement respecting tithes, I am
happy to find an uniform opinion in favor of the proposal, among all
the Irish I have seen; and I am more and more convinced that those
measures, with some effectual mode to enforce the residence of <em>all</em> ranks
of the Protestant clergy, offer the best chance of gradually putting an
end to the evils most felt in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>
</div>


<p>The suggestion that Foster's opposition might be obviated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>by the promise of a peerage emanated first from Camden.
Its adoption by Pitt marks the first step in the by-paths of
bribery on which he now entered. In this case his action is
not indefensible; for the abolition of the Speakership at Dublin
naturally involved some indemnity. Besides, in that Parliament
no important measure passed without bribery. That eager
democrat, Hamilton Rowan, foresaw in the Union "the downfall
of one of the most corrupt assemblies I believe ever existed."
The proprietors of the pocket-boroughs were needy and grasping,
some of them living by the sale of presentation of seats.
Government generally managed to control them, but only on
condition of dispensing favours proportionate to the importance
of the suitor and the corruptness of the occasion. As Beresford
remarked with unconscious humour, the borough-mongers "cannot
be expected to give up their interest for nothing; and those
who bought their seats cannot be expected to give up their term
for nothing." Here he expressed the general conviction of that
age, which Pitt recognized in his Reform Bill of 1785 by seeking
to indemnify the borough-holders of Great Britain.</p>

<p>A typical specimen of the borough-owner was that "ill-tempered,
violent fellow," Lord Downshire, who controlled the
Crown patronage in the North by virtue of his seven borough
seats. Lord Ely had six seats; and the Duke of Devonshire, and
Lords Abercorn, Belmore, Clifden, Granard, and Shannon, four
apiece. In the counties, Downshire, the Ponsonbys, and the
Beresfords controlled about twenty seats. Camden, writing to
Pitt on 11th August 1799, thus described Downshire: "He is
not personally corrupt; but the larger the compensation for the
boroughs is to be, the more readily will he listen to you or Lord
Castlereagh."<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> Lord Longueville, a borough-owner of great influence
in County Cork, wrote as follows to Pitt on 3rd December,
1798:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>... Long attached to you, and confirmed in that attachment for life
by the direction and advice of Lord Westmorland, I have now no object
to look up to, to prevent my falling a sacrifice to my political enemies,
but to you. When Lord Shannon opposed your measures, I spent
&pound;30,000 of my own money to frustrate his intentions and support your
measures. I shall now act by your advice and opinion on this great
business of a Union with Great Britain. My friends are numerous and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>firm; they look up to you for decision on every occasion. My interest
in Ireland is extensive. I wish to be a British peer before the measure
of a Union takes place, or after. I wish the city of Cork to have two
members, Bantry one and Mallow one.</p>
</div>


<p>Longueville gained his desire and the patronage of the Revenue
offices in Cork City.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> From Pitt's letter to Cornwallis it is clear
that he believed that the promise of Government stipends for
the Catholic clergy, and a reform in tithes would induce them
to support the Union. But it seems impossible to reconcile his
statement as to Beresford's opposition to the Union with the
assertion of the latter, that, in an interview of 12th November,
he pressed Pitt to take immediate steps to ensure the success of
the measure, which otherwise would have to struggle against
unfair odds at Dublin. The curious tendency of Hibernian affairs
towards confusion also appears in Cornwallis's statement, on
15th November, that he had urged Pitt not to close the door
to the Catholics in the United Parliament. Whereas Pitt was
resolved to admit them at an early opportunity.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p>On the various interests at stake there is in the Pretyman
archives a long but undated Memorandum, with notes at the side
by Pitt, or perhaps by Grenville; for their writing, when cramped,
was similar. It recommends that the precedent of the Union with
the Scottish Parliament shall be followed where possible; that few
changes shall be made in the Irish legal system, appeals being
allowed to the Irish Lord Chancellor and three chief judges,
who may also deal with evidence for parliamentary and private
Bills affecting Ireland. The general aim should be to lessen the
expense of resort to the United Parliament for private business.
Pitt here added at the side&mdash;"Particularly in divorces and exchange
of lands in settlement," also in certain "private" Bills.
The compiler then refers to the difficulty of assessing or equalizing
the Revenues, National Debts, and the fiscal systems of
the two islands, but suggests that on the last topic Pitt's Irish
proposals of 1785 shall be followed. To this Pitt assents, suggesting
also that the proportions of Revenue and Debt may soon
be arranged provisionally, Commissioners being appointed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>discuss the future and definitive quotas. Further, Pitt expresses
the desire to model the election of Irish peers on that of
Scottish peers. The compiler of the plan advises a delegation
of 40 Irish peers, and not less than 120 Commoners to Westminster;
but, as electoral changes are highly dangerous to both
countries, he drafts a scheme by which either 125 or 138 Irish
Commoners will sit in the United Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<p>Here Pitt and his colleagues differed from their adviser. Probably
they heard rumours of the fears aroused by the advent of
Irish members. The repose of Lord Sheffield was troubled by
thoughts of the irruption of "100 wild Irishmen"; and he deemed
the arrival of 75 quite sufficient, if staid country gentlemen were
not to be scared away from St. Stephen's. By way of compromise
the Cabinet fixed the number at 100 on or before 25th
November 1798.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> At that date Portland also informed Cornwallis
that the number of Irish Peers at Westminster must not
exceed 32.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the tangle at Dublin was becoming hopeless.
There, as Beresford warned Pitt, the report of the proposed
Union was the letting out of water. Captain Saurin, an eminent
counsel who was commander of a corps of lawyers nick-named
the Devil's Own, insisted on parading his battalion in order to
harangue them on the insult to Ireland and the injury to their
profession. His example was widely followed. On 9th December
the Dublin Bar, by 168 votes to 32, protested strongly
against the proposal to extinguish the Irish Parliament. Eloquent
speakers like Plunket warned that body that suicide was the
supreme act of cowardice, besides being <span lang="la">ultra vires</span>. The neighbouring
towns and counties joined in the clamour. The somnolence
of Cornwallis, his neglect to win over opponents by tact
or material inducements, and the absence of any Ministerial declaration
on the subject, left all initiative to the Opposition. On
24th December Cooke wrote to Auckland in these doleful terms:<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>... Our Union politics are not at present very thriving. Pamphlets
are in shoals, in general against a Union; a few for it; but I do not yet
see anything of superior talent and effect. The tide in Dublin is difficult
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>to stem. In the country hitherto, indifference. We have no account
from the North, and that is the quarter I apprehend. The South will
not be very hostile. The Bar is most impetuous and active, and I
cannot be surprized at it. The Corporation have not sense to see that
by an Union alone the Corporation can be preserved. Most of the best
merchants are, I know, not averse. The proprietors of Dublin and the
county are violent, and shopkeepers, etc. The Catholics hold back.
They are on the watch to make the most of the game, and will intrigue
with both parties.... In the North they expect the Dutch fleet. If we had
a more able active conciliating Chief, we might do; but the <span lang="la">vis inertiae</span>
is incredible. There is an amazing disgust among the friends of Government.
The tone of loyalty is declining, for want of being cherished.
Do not be surprized at a dreadful parliamentary opposition and a personal
opposition.</p>
</div>


<p>Cooke's reference to the mediocrity of the pamphlets for the
Union is a curious piece of <span lang="fr">finesse</span>; for he was known to be the
author of an able pamphlet, "Arguments for and against an
Union between Great Britain and Ireland." In it he dilated on
the benefits gained by Wales and Scotland from a Union with
England. He dwelt on the recent increase of strength in France
consequent on the concentration of political power at Paris, and
demonstrated the unreality of the boasted independence of the
Dublin Parliament, seeing that Irish enactments must be sealed
by the Seal of Great Britain. After touching on the dangerous
divergence of policy at Westminster and Dublin during the
Regency crisis of 1789, he showed that peace and prosperity
must increase under a more comprehensive system, which would
both guarantee the existence of the Established Church, and
accord civic recognition to Catholics. At present, said he, it
would be dangerous to admit Catholics to the Irish Parliament;
but in the United Parliament such a step would be practicable.
This semi-official pronouncement caused a sensation, and before
the end of the year twenty-four replies appeared. In one of the
counterblasts the anonymous author offers "the reflections of a
plain and humble mind," by stating forthwith that the policy of
the British Government had been to foment discontent, to excite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>jealousies, to connive at insurrections, and finally to "amnestize"
those rebellions, for the purpose of promoting its favourite and
now avowed object of a Union.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p>Far abler is the "Reply" to Cooke by Richard Jebb, who
afterwards became a Justice of the King's Bench in Ireland. He
showed that only in regard to the Regency had any serious
difference arisen between the two Parliaments; he scoffed at the
notion of Ireland's needs finding satisfaction at Westminster.
Would Pitt, he asked, who whirled out of the Cabinet the gigantic
Thurlow, ever attend to Irish affairs? Jebb then quoted with
effect Clare's assertion that the Irish Parliament alone was competent
to deal with the business of the island. He admitted the
directing power of the British Cabinet over Ireland's concerns;
but he averred that under the new system the Lord Lieutenant
would be little more than a Great Contractor. As to the satisfaction
to be granted to Catholics, the Under-Secretary had done
well not to be too explicit, lest he should offend jealous Protestants.
But, asked Jebb, would the Catholics have much influence
in the United Kingdom, where they would be, not three
to one as in Ireland, but three to fourteen? Nature herself had
intended England and Scotland to be one country; she had
proclaimed the need of some degree of independence in Ireland.
Finally, he deprecated in the mouth of an official a reference to
the success attending the policy of annexation pursued by France,
which Pitt had always reprobated. The effect produced by these
replies appears in a letter of Lees to Auckland on 29th December.
Dublin, he writes, is in a frenzy against the Union. As for
Cornwallis, he was as apathetic as usual: "We are asleep, while
the disaffected are working amain."<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>Not until 21st December did Pitt and his colleagues come to
a final decision to press on the Act of Union at all costs. On
that day he held a Cabinet meeting in Downing Street, all
being present, as well as the Earl of Liverpool and Earl Camden.
The following Minute of their resolution was taken by Lord
Grenville.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>That the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland should be instructed to state
without delay to all persons with whom he may have communication
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>on this subject, that His Majesty's Government is decided to press the
measure of an Union as essential to the well-being of both countries
and particularly to the security and peace of Ireland as dependent on
its connection with Great Britain: that this object will now be urged to
the utmost, and will even in the case (if it should happen) of any present
failure, be renewed on every occasion till it succeed; and that the
conduct of individuals on this subject will be considered as the test of
their disposition to support the King's Government.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>
</div>


<p>Portland forthwith informed the Lord-Lieutenant, Cornwallis,
of the purport of this resolution. Drastic proceedings were now
inevitable; for mischievous rumours were rife at Dublin that nobody
would suffer for his vote against the Union.</p>

<p>A brief Declaration as to the essentials of the Government
plan was issued at Dublin on 5th January 1799. It stated that
twenty-eight temporal peers elected for life would be delegated
to Westminster, and four Protestant bishops, taken in rotation.
Irish peers not elected might sit for British counties and
boroughs, as before. The Crown retained the right of creating
Irish peers. As to the delegation of the Commons of Ireland,
each county or large town now returning two members could
send only one to Westminster, except Dublin and Cork, each of
which would return two members. Of the 108 small boroughs,
one half would return members for one Parliament, the other
half for the next Parliament. In the sphere of commerce Ireland
would enjoy the same advantages as Great Britain, the duties
between the two islands being equalized, the linen manufacturers
retaining their special privileges. The Exchequer and National
Debt of each island were to continue separate, the quota paid
by Ireland into the Imperial Exchequer being reserved for
future consideration, it being understood that when the Irish
Revenue exceeded its expenses, the excess must be applied to
local purposes, the taxes producing the excess being duly
modified.</p>

<p>Apart from the inevitable vagueness as to the proportion of
Ireland's quota, the Declaration was calculated to reassure Irishmen.
The borough-mongers lost only one half of their lucrative
patronage. True, the change bore hard upon the 180 Irish
peers, of whom only one in six would enter the House of Lords
at Westminster. But commerce was certain to thrive now that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>the British Empire unreservedly threw open its markets to Irish
products; and in the political sphere the Act of Union, by shattering
the Irish pocket-borough system, assigned an influence to
the larger towns such as those of Great Britain did not enjoy
until the time of the Reform Bill. Nothing, it is true, was said to
encourage the Catholics; but in Cooke's semi-official pamphlet
they had been led to hope for justice in the United Parliament.</p>

<p>The following letter of Cooke to Castlereagh (6th January) is
interesting:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>We shall have difficult work; but there is no need to despair. I do
not hear of anything formidable from the country. Armagh is stirred by
Lord Charlemont; Louth, I suppose, by the Speaker; Lord Enniskillen
will move Fermanagh; Queen's County will be against [us]. I hear
Waterford, Cork, Kerry, Limerick is [<span lang="la">sic</span>] with us. Sir Edward O'Brien
in Clare is against and is stirring. Derry will be quiet, if not favourable.
The North is so in general at present. The sketch of terms thrown out
is much relished. I cannot tell you how our numbers will stand on the
22nd. The Catholics will wait upon the question, and will not declare
till they think they can act with effect. Many persons are anxious to
make them part of the measure. Grattan is come. I know not yet what
he is doing. I hope all friends in London will be sent over. The first
burst is everything. It would be decisive if the Prince of Wales would
declare publicly in favour and hoist his banner for the Union.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>
</div>


<p>Apart from this enigmatical reference, there were few grounds
for hope. The landlords and traders of Dublin naturally opposed
a measure certain to lessen the importance of that city.
Trinity College, the Corporation of Dublin, and the gentry and
freeholders of County Dublin all protested against Union.
Equally hostile were most Irish Protestants. In their pride as
a dominant Order, they scorned the thought of subordination
to Great Britain. Sixteen years of almost complete legislative
independence had quickened their national feelings; and many
of them undoubtedly set love of country before the promptings
of caste. How was it possible, they asked, that the claims of
Ireland should receive due attention amidst the clash of worldwide
interests at Westminster?</p>

<p>Doubts like these should have been set at rest. Surely Pitt
missed a great opportunity in not promising the appointment of
a perpetual committee at Westminster, elected by the Irish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>members for the consideration of their local affairs. A similar
committee for Scottish business would also have been a statesmanlike
proposal, in view of the increase of work certain to
result from the Union. Doubtless those committees would have
interfered with the functions of the Lord Lieutenant at Dublin,
and the Scottish patronage controlled by Henry Dundas. But
some such measure would have appeased the discontent rife in
both kingdoms, and, while easing the strain on the Imperial
Parliament, would have nurtured the growth of that wider
patriotism which has its roots in local affections.</p>

<p>A survey of the facts passed under review must, I think, lead
to the conclusion that the conduct of Pitt in preparing for the
Act of Union was halting and ineffective. It is true that Camden
had advised him to make careful preliminary inquiries; but they
were not instituted until October 1798, and they dragged on to
the end of the year, by which time the fear of a French invasion
had subsided. There were but two satisfactory ways of carrying
the Act of Union through the hostile Parliament at Dublin.
In June&ndash;October, during the panic caused by the Rebellion and
the French raids, Pitt might have intimated secretly though
officially to the leading loyalists that Great Britain could not
again pour forth her blood and treasure for an unworkable system,
and that the acceptance of that help must imply acquiescence
in a Union. Such a compact would of course be termed
unchivalrous by the rhetoricians at St. Stephen's Green; but it
would have prevented the unchivalrous conduct of many so-called
loyalists, who, after triumphing by England's aid, then,
relying upon that aid for the future, thwarted Pitt's remedial
policy. Prudence should have enjoined the adoption of some
such precaution in the case of men whose behaviour was exacting
towards England and exasperating towards the majority of
Irishmen. In neglecting to take it, Pitt evinced a strange lack
of foresight. At this point George&nbsp;III showed himself the
shrewder tactician; for he urged that Cornwallis must take
steps to frighten the loyal minority into accepting an Act of
Union.</p>

<p>But there was an alternative course of action. Failing to come
to an understanding with the ultra-Protestant zealots of Dublin,
Pitt might have elicited a strong declaration from the many
Irishmen who were in favour of Union. He seems to have
taken no such step. Though aware that Cornwallis was in civil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
affairs a figure-head, he neglected to send over a spokesman
capable of giving a decided lead. In the ensuing debates at
Dublin, Castlereagh showed the toughness, energy, and resourcefulness
which, despite his halting cumbrous style, made him a
power in Parliament; but his youth and his stiff un-Hibernian
ways told against him. Beresford was detained by illness in
London; and Clare, after his return to Dublin, did strangely
little for the cause. Thus, at this critical time the Unionists
were without a lead and without a leader. The autumn of 1798
was frittered away in interviews in London, the purport of which
ought to have clearly appeared two or three months earlier.
The passive attitude and tardy action of Pitt and Portland in
these critical weeks offer a strange contrast to the habits of clear
thinking and forceful action characteristic of Napoleon. It is
painful to compare their procedure with the action of the First
Consul in speedily bringing ecclesiastical bigots and fanatical
atheists to the working compromise summed up in the Concordat.
In the case of the Union, the initiative, energy, and
zeal, which count for much among a Celtic people, passed to
the side of Pitt's opponents. Thenceforth that measure could
be carried through the Irish Parliament only by coercion or
bribery.</p>

<p class="title spaced">THE UNION (continued)</p>

<p class="quote">"We must consider it as a measure of great national policy, the object of
which is effectually to counteract the restless machinations of an inveterate
enemy, who has uniformly and anxiously endeavoured to effect a separation
between the two countries."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pitt</span>, Speech on the Union, <i>21st April, 1800</i>.</p>


<p>On 22nd January 1799 the long talked-of Act of Union was
pointedly referred to in the King's Speech read out to the
Irish Parliament. The Speech was adopted by the House of
Lords, amendments hostile to the proposed measure being rejected
by large majorities. But in the House of Commons
nationalist zeal raged with ever-increasing fury from dusk until
the dawn of the following day. In vain had Castlereagh made
liberal use of the sum of &pound;5,000 which he begged Pitt to send
over to serve as a <span lang="la">primum mobile</span> at Dublin. In vain had he
"worked like a horse." The feeling against the measure was too
strong to be allayed by bribery of a retail kind.</p>

<p>Owing to ill health Grattan was not present. Sir John Parnell,
Chancellor of the Exchequer, was among the less violent opponents;
but the most telling appeal was that of Plunket, an
Ulsterman. With an eloquence which even won votes he denied
either the right of the Government to propose such a measure
or the competence of that Assembly to commit political suicide.
If the Act of Union were passed, he said, no one in Ireland would
obey it. Then, turning to the Speaker, he exclaimed: "You are
appointed to make laws and not Legislatures. You are appointed
to exercise the functions of legislators, and not to transfer them;
and if you do so, your act is a dissolution of the Government."
On behalf of Government Castlereagh made a well-reasoned
reply; but his speech was too laboured to commend a cause
which offended both the sentiments and interests of members;
and the Opposition was beaten by only one vote&mdash;106 to 105.
The debate was marked by curious incidents. Sir Jonah Barrington,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
a chronicler of these events, declared that Cooke,
perturbed by the threatened defection of a member named
French, whispered to Castlereagh, and then, sidling up to the
erring placeman, spoke long and earnestly until smiles spread
over the features of both. A little later French rose to state his
regret at the opinions which he had previously expressed. The
story is not convincing in the case of a building provided with
committee-rooms; but there can be no doubt that bribery went
on before the debate. The final voting showed that there were
limits to that form of influence. Even the canvassing of Castlereagh
failed to persuade members to pass sentence of political
death on half of their number and of transportation on the
remainder. The joy of the men of Dublin found expression in a
spontaneous illumination, and the mob broke all windows which
were not lit up.</p>

<p>On all sides the procedure of the Government met with severe
censure. As usual, blame was lavished upon Cornwallis, Lord
Carysfort warning Grenville that the defeat was due to the disgust
of "Orangemen and exterminators" at his clemency. Buckingham,
writing to Pitt on 29th January, reported that on the
estimate of Archbishop Troy, nine-tenths of the Irish Catholics
were for the Union: "Remember, however," he added, "that this
can only be done by the removal of Lord Cornwallis and Lord
Castlereagh.... I protest I see no salvation but in the immediate
change. Send us Lord Winchilsea, or rather Lord Euston,
or in short send us any one. But send us Steele as his Secretary,
and with firmness the Question (and with it Ireland) will
be saved. Excuse this earnestness."<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> Pitt took no notice of
this advice, but continued to support Cornwallis. As for the
Irish Executive, it proceeded now to the policy of official coercion
recommended from Downing Street. Parnell was dismissed
from the Exchequer; the Prime Serjeant was deposed, and four
opponents of Union were removed from subordinate posts,
among them being Foster, son of the Speaker.</p>

<p>So confident was Pitt of victory at Dublin that he introduced
the Bill of Union at Westminster on 23rd January. The King's
Speech referred to the designs of enemies and traitors to separate
Ireland from Great Britain, and counselled the adoption of
means for perpetuating the connection. Forthwith Sheridan
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>moved a hostile amendment. With his wonted zeal and eloquence,
he urged the inopportuneness of such a measure when
40,000 British troops were holding down Ireland, and he denied
the competence either of the British or Irish Parliament to decide
on it. Pitt promptly refuted Sheridan's plea by referring to the
action of the English and Scottish Parliaments at the time of
their Union, and he twitted him with seeking to perpetuate at
Dublin a system whose injustice and cruelty he had always reprobated.
Allowing that British rule in Ireland had been narrow
and intolerant, Pitt foretold the advent of a far different
state of things after the Union. Then, pointing to the divergence
of British and Irish policy at the time of the Regency crisis
he pronounced it a dangerous omen, and declared the Union to
be necessary to the peace and stability of the Empire. The
House agreed with him and negatived the amendment without a
division.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that of Sheridan's hypothetical colleagues
in office under the Prince Regent in the Cabinet outlined in
February 1789, not one now supported him. Fox was not present,
being engrossed in Lucretius and the "Poetics" of Aristotle.
He, however, informed Lord Holland that he detested the
Union and all centralized Governments, his predilection being
for Federalism.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> The remark merits notice in view of the concentration
of power in France, and in her vassal Republics at
Rome, Milan, Genoa, and Amsterdam. That eager student of
the Classics wished to dissolve the British Isles into their component
parts at a time when the highly organized energy of the
French race was threatening every neighbouring State. While the
tricolour waved at Amsterdam, Mainz, Berne, Rome, Valetta, and
Cairo, Fox thought it opportune to federalize British institutions.
The means whereby Pitt sought to solidify them are open to
question. But which of the two statesmen had the sounder sense?</p>

<p>On 31st January, after the receipt of the disappointing news
from Dublin, Pitt returned to the charge. Expressing deep
regret that the Irish House of Commons should have rejected
the plan of a Union before it knew the details, he proceeded to
describe the proposals of the Government. Firstly, he insisted
that it was the concerted action of invaders from without and
traitors within that made the measure necessary. He then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>argued that the settlement of 1782, according legislative independence
to the Irish Parliament, was far from final, as appeared
in the ministerial declarations of that time. Moreover, Irish
Bills did not become law unless sanctioned by the King and
sealed by the Great Seal of Great Britain on the advice of British
Ministers, facts which implied the dependence of the Irish Parliament.
Turning to the commercial issues at stake, he effectively
quoted the statement of Foster to the Irish House of Commons
in 1785, that they would be mad to reject the commercial proposals
then offered, which, if thrown out, would not be renewed.
But now, said Pitt, they are renewed in the projected Union;
and Foster has used his influence to reject a measure which
breaks down the fiscal barriers between the two kingdoms. After
referring to the Regency Question, he pointed out the danger of
France attacking the British race at its weakest point. Never
would she cease to assail it until the Union was indissoluble.
Commerce, he said, was the source of wealth; and the wealth
needed to withstand the predatory designs of France would be
enhanced by a free interchange of British and Irish products.
The Union would encourage the flow into the poorer island of
British capital which it so much needed. Next, adverting to the
religious feuds in Ireland, he remarked on the danger of granting
concessions to the Irish Catholics while Ireland remained a distinct
kingdom. He then uttered these momentous words:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>On the other hand, without anticipating the discussion, or the propriety
of agitating the question, or saying how soon or how late it may
be fit to discuss it, two propositions are indisputable; first, when the
conduct of the Catholics shall be such as to make it safe for the
Government to admit them to the participation of the privileges granted
to those of the established religion, and when the temper of the times
shall be favourable to such a measure&mdash;when these events take place, it
is obvious that such a question may be agitated in an United Imperial
Parliament with much greater safety, than it could be in a separate
Legislature. In the second place, I think it certain that, even for whatever
period it may be thought necessary after the Union to withhold
from the Catholics the enjoyment of those advantages, many of the
objections which at present arise out of their situation would be removed,
if the Protestant Legislature were no longer separate and local,
but general and Imperial: and the Catholics themselves would at once
feel a mitigation of the most goading and irritating of their present
causes of complaint.</p>
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>
<p>Pitt then deprecated the effort to inflame the insular pride of
Irishmen. Could Irishmen really object to unite with Britons?
For it was no subordinate place that they were asked to take,
but one of equality and honour. Most happily then did he quote
the vow of Aeneas for an equal and lasting compact between
his Trojans and the Italians:</p>


<p class="poem" lang="la" style="font-style: normal">
Non ego nec Teucris Italos parere jubebo,<br />
Nec nova regna peto: paribus se legibus ambae<br />
Invictae gentes aeterna in foedera mittant.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor" style="font-style: normal">[557]</a>
</p>


<p>He ended his speech by moving eight Resolutions on the
question; and the House approved their introduction by 140
votes to 15. This statesmanlike survey lacked the fire and
imaginative elevation of his speech on the Slave Trade in
1792. But there was little need of rhetoric and invective. Pitt's
aim was to convince Ireland of the justice of his proposals.
And his plea, though weak at one point, must rank among the
ablest expositions of a great and complex question. How different
the course of events might have been if the Commons of
Ireland had first heard Pitt's proposals of Union, clearly and
authoritatively set forth, not in the distorted form which rumour
or malice depicted. In this respect Gladstone proved himself an
abler tactician than Pitt. His Home Rule Bill of 1886 remained
a secret until it was described in that masterly statement which
formed a worthy retort to Pitt's oration of 31st January 1799.
Pitt prepared it with great care, so Auckland avers; and, as he
and Long had secured the presence of the best reporters, the
text of the speech is among the most accurate that we possess
for that period. He now resolved to bring forward specific
Resolutions, instead of, as before, proposing merely to appoint
Commissioners to consider the details of the Bill of Union. It is
unfortunate that he did not take this step at first. The mistake
probably resulted from his besetting sin&mdash;excess of confidence.
On 26th January he expressed to Cornwallis his deep disappointment
and grief at the action of the Dublin Parliament,
which he ascribed to prejudice and cabal. Clearly he had
underrated the force of the nationalist opposition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile Castlereagh endeavoured to reckon the value of the
pecuniary interests in Ireland opposed to the Union. In a
characteristically narrow spirit he assessed the losses to borough-holders
at &pound;756,000; to controllers of counties at &pound;224,000; to
barristers at &pound;200,000; to purchasers of parliamentary seats at
&pound;75,000; and he estimated the probable depreciation of property
in Dublin at &pound;200,000. Thus, moneyed interests worth
&pound;1,433,000 were arrayed against the Union. He proposed to
whittle down these claims by raising the number of Irish
members in the United Parliament either to 127 or 141. Both
at Dublin and Westminster Ministers were intent on appeasing
hostile interests on the easiest terms. Among Pitt's papers is a
curious estimate of the opinion of the propertied classes in the
counties and chief towns of Ireland. "Property" is declared to
favour the Union in Antrim, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway,
Kerry, Leitrim, Londonderry, Mayo, Waterford, and Wexford.
It was hostile in Carlow, Cavan, Dublin, Fermanagh, Kildare,
and Louth. In the other counties it was divided on the subject.
Among the towns, Cork, Galway, Lisburne, Londonderry,
Waterford, and Wexford supported Union. Clonmell, Drogheda,
and Dublin opposed it; while Belfast, Kilkenny, and
Limerick were doubtful. Most of the Grand Juries petitioned
for Union, only those of Dublin, Louth, Queen's County, and
Wicklow pronouncing against it.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> In view of the expected
attempt of the Brest fleet, the Grand Jury of Cork burst into a
patriotic rhapsody which must be placed on record:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter"><i>March 26, 1799</i>.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>... At the present awful moment whilst we await the threatened
attempt of the enemies of religion and of man to crush us in their
sacrilegious embrace; whilst their diabolical influence cherishes rebellion
and promotes assassination in the land, we look back with gratitude
to the timely interposition of Great Britain, which has more
than once rescued us from that infidel yoke under which so great a
portion of distracted Europe at this moment groans. We have still to
acknowledge how necessary that interposition is to protect us from the
further attempts of an unprincipled foe,&nbsp;... and to her assistance we are
... indebted for keeping down an unnatural but wide extended rebellion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>within the bosom of this country. To become a constituent part of that
Empire to whose protection we owe our political existence and whose
constitution is the admiration of the civilized world; to participate in
those resources which are inexhaustible; to become joint proprietors of
that navy which is irresistible; and to share in that commerce which
knows no bounds, are objects beyond which our most sanguine wishes
for the wealth and prosperity of Ireland cannot possibly extend, whilst
the prospect which they hold forth of terminating the jarring interests of
party and reconciling the jealous distinctions of religion, promises a
restoration of that tranquillity to which the country has too long been a
stranger.</p>
</div>


<p>This exuberant loyalty may have been heightened by the hope
that Cork would reap from the Union a commercial harvest
equal to that which raised Glasgow from a city of 12,700 souls
before the Anglo-Scottish Union, to one of nearly 70,000 in the
year 1800. But the men of Cork forgot that that marvellous
increase was due to the coal, iron, and manufactures of Lanarkshire,
no less than to free participation in the trade of the
Empire.</p>

<p>The fact that Cork was then far more Unionist than Belfast is
apt to perplex the reader until he realizes that Roman Catholics
for the most part favoured Union, not so much from loyalty to
George&nbsp;III, as from the conviction that only in the Imperial
Parliament could they gain full religious equality. On the other
hand the Presbyterians of Ulster had fewer grievances to be
redressed, and were not without hope of gaining satisfaction
from the Protestant Legislature at Dublin. It is certain that
the Catholic Archbishops of Dublin and Tuam, besides Bishop
Moylan of Cork and other prelates, used their influence on
behalf of the Union. Cornwallis was known to favour the Catholic
claims; and Wilberforce, writing to Pitt, says: "I have long
wished to converse with you a little concerning the part proper
for you to take when the Catholic Question should come before
the House. I feel it due to the long friendship which has subsisted
between us to state to you unreservedly my sentiments
on this very important occasion, especially as I fear they are
different from your own."<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> Pitt does not seem to have welcomed
the suggestion couched in these magisterial terms, and,
as the sequel will show, he had good grounds for concealing his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>hand. Only at one point did the Cabinet declare its intentions.
There being some fear that the Opposition at Dublin would
seek to win over the Catholics by the offer of Emancipation, the
Government declared its resolve to oppose any step in this
direction so long as that Parliament existed.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<p>It is well also to remember that the concession of the franchise
to the bulk of the Irish peasantry in 1793, with the full approval
of Pitt, enabled the Catholics to control the elections in the
counties and "open" boroughs except in Ulster. Therefore,
though they could not send to Parliament men of their creed,
they could in many instances keep out Protestants who were
inimical to their interests. In the present case, then, Catholic
influence was certain to tell powerfully, though indirectly, in
favour of Union. These facts explain the progress of the
cause early in the year 1799. Opponents of the measure began
to tremble for their seats owing to the action either of Government
or of the Catholic vote. Accordingly, despite the frantic
efforts of Lord Downshire and Foster, Government carried the
day by 123 to 103 (15th February). Fear worked on behalf of
Union. A great fleet was fitting out at Brest, the Dutch ports
were alive with work, and again Ireland was believed to be the
aim of the Republicans. As was the case in 1798, they encouraged
numbers of Irishmen to make pikes, to muster on the
hills of Cork and Wicklow, dealing murder and havoc in the
plains by night. Cornwallis therefore proclaimed martial law,
armed the yeomen, and sought to crush the malcontents, a
proceeding which led critics to charge Government with inciting
the people to outrage in order to coerce them. Those who
flung out the sneer should also have proved that the naval preparations
at Brest and the Texel were instigated from Downing
Street in order to carry the Union.</p>

<p>The real feelings of Dublin officials appear in the letters of
Beresford, Cooke, and Lees to Auckland. On 15th March
1799 Beresford writes: "Our business is going on smoothly in
Parliament; from the day that Government took the courage
[<span lang="la">sic</span>] of dividing with the Opposition, they have grown weaker
and weaker every day as I foretold to you they would. The
Speaker [Foster], as I hear, appears to be much softened. I am
sure he sees that he has pledged himself too far, and that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>cannot depend upon those who heretofore supported him: and
both he and Ponsonby are conscious that the point will be
carried and they, of course, left in the lurch.... The country is
in a wretched way, organization going on everywhere; and if
the French should land, I much fear that there will be very universal
risings." On the subject of inter-insular trade Beresford
informs Auckland on 29th March that Ireland depends almost
entirely upon Great Britain and her colonies, having a balance
in her favour in that trade but an adverse balance in her dealings
with foreign lands. She exports 41,670,000 yards of linen to
Great Britain and only 4,762,000 yards to other lands. Besides,
the British trade is increasing fast, as England uses less and less
foreign linen. On the morrow, Cooke declares that, if the
French do not land, the Irish malcontents will settle down. Commending
the policy of going slowly with the Union, he says:
"By letting the subject cool, by opening its nature, tendencies,
and advantages, and seeming not to press it, and by insinuating
that no other course of safety to property remains, the mind
begins to think seriously and faints. I think during the Vacation
pains may be taken with the House of Commons so as to give us
a fair majority, and if the Catholics act steadily we should be
able to carry the point. I could wish that Mr. Pitt would suffer
some person of ability to prepare all the necessary Bills, and to
fill up every detail; so that the measure might be seen in its
complete stage. I despair of this being done, tho' obviously
right; for Ministers never will act till they are forced, and I do
not wonder at it."<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>Again, all the energy was on the side of the Opposition. On
11th April Foster passed the whole subject in review in a speech
of four hours' duration. In order to weaken one of the strongest
of Pitt's arguments, he proposed that in case of a Regency, the
Regent, who was chosen at Westminster, should necessarily be
Regent at Dublin. This proposal of <span class="ins" title="couse">course</span> implied the dependence
of the Irish Parliament on that of Great Britain; but, as
invalidating one of the chief pleas for Union, Foster pressed it
home. He also charged Pitt with endeavouring to wring a large
sum of money every year from Ireland. The speech made a deep
impression. The only way of deadening its influence and
stopping the Regency Bill was to postpone it until August and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>summarily to close the session on 1st June. The meanness of
this device is a tribute to the power of Foster and the mediocrity
of the officials of Dublin Castle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the naval situation had cleared up, so far as concerns
Ireland. On 25th April Admiral Bruix, with a powerful fleet,
slipped out from Brest by night past Lord Bridport's blockading
force. For some days panic reigned in London, and it is significant
that Bridport took especial measures to guard the coasts of
Ireland, thus enabling the French to get clear away to the Mediterranean.
With bolder tactics they should have been able to
reduce the new British possession, Minorca, or annihilate the
small force blockading Malta. The relief felt at Dublin Castle,
on hearing of Bruix' southward voyage, appears in Beresford's
letter of 15th May, in which he refers to the revival of loyalty
and the terrible number of hangings by courts martial: "We
consider ourselves as safe from the French for this year; but I
am in great anxiety for my friend St. Vincent. What steps will
be taken against those damned dogs in the Mediterranean?...
I expect that the French going to the Mediterranean, instead of
coming to the assistance of their friends here, will have a very
great effect upon the people of this country, who, as soon as
they find that they have been made fools of will endeavour to
get out of the scrape they are in." On 1st June Cooke writes
"secretly" to Auckland, expressing regret that Pitt ever attacked
Foster, whose opposition is most weighty. The Cabinet lost the
measure by want of good management in 1798: and the same is
now the case. Nothing has been done to win over Lord Downshire
with his eight votes, or Lords Donegal and De Clifford,
who had half as many. He even asks whether Pitt will think it
worth while to spend three months' work on the Union now that
the French had gone to the Mediterranean.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> The question reveals
the prevalence of the belief that Pitt paid little attention to
Irish affairs. Probably it arose from his stiffness of manner and
his execrable habit of leaving letters unanswered. This defect
had become incurable, witness the complaint of Wilberforce to
Addington&mdash;"You know how difficult, I may say next to
impossible, it is to extort a line from Pitt."<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></p>

<p>In July the return of Bruix with the Cadiz fleet into the Atlantic
renewed the fears of Irish loyalists and the hopes of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>malcontents. The combined fleet managed to enter Brest on
13th August 1799; and its presence there was a continual source
of unsettlement to Ireland, preparations for revolt being kept up
in several parts. A large British force was therefore kept in
Ireland, not for the purpose of forcing through the Union, as
Pitt's enemies averred, but in order to guard against invasion
and rebellion. Though reinforcements arrived, Cornwallis complained
that he had not enough troops. On 24th July 1799 he
informed the Duke of Portland that he had only 45,000 regular
infantry, a number sufficient to preserve order but totally inadequate
to repel an invasion in force. Thus the facts of the case
are, that French threats to tear Ireland from Great Britain kept
up the threatening ferment and necessitated the presence of a
considerable military force; but they also led Pitt to insist on
the Union as a means of thwarting all separatist efforts whether
from without or from within. It is clear, however, that Pitt and
Earl Spencer trusted to Bridport's powerful squadron to intercept
any large expedition of the enemy. The blow then preparing
against the Dutch was in part intended to ensure the safety
of the British Isles.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at Westminster the cause of the Union met with
almost universal approval. The debate in the Lords on 11th
April elicited admirable speeches, from Dr. Watson, the learned
Bishop of Llandaff, and from Lords Auckland and Minto. Only
Lords Holland, King, and Thanet protested against the measure.
In the Commons, Lord Sheffield, while supporting the Union,
reproved Ministers for allowing their aim to become known in
Ireland several weeks before the details of their proposals were
made public. The measure received warm support from Canning,
who a month earlier had resigned the Under-Secretaryship for
Foreign Affairs, and was now for the time merely on the India
Board of Control, with a sinecure superadded. The sensitive
young Irishman had found it impossible to work with the cold
and austere Grenville; and his place was taken for a time by his
coadjutor on the "Anti-Jacobin," Hookham Frere, to whom the
Grenville yoke proved scarcely less irksome.</p>

<p>Canning flung himself with ardour into the struggle for the
Union, and proved a match for his brilliant fellow countryman,
Sheridan. He combated the notion that the Irish Parliament
was unalterably opposed to the measure, and, arguing from the
contemptuous manner in which the French had met our overtures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
for peace, he inferred their resolve to sever Ireland from
the Empire. In animated style he declared that Ireland would
not lose but gain in dignity by the Union, which would confer
on her what she most needed, stronger and steadier government.
On this occasion Sheridan did not speak, and Fox was absent.
After a protest by Lord William Russell against infringing the
final settlement of 1782, Pitt arose merely in order to challenge
this statement and to read the letters of the Duke of Portland
to Lord Shelburne of May&ndash;June 1782; they refuted Russell's
contention only in so far as to show that Ministers then designed
to legislate further on the subject. The Irish Parliament certainly
regarded the legislative independence then granted as
complete and final. The House of Commons supported Pitt by
a unanimous vote.</p>

<p>During the summer the outlook at Dublin became somewhat
brighter, as appears from the following "secret" letter of Cooke
to Lord Camden. After congratulating him on receiving the
Garter, he continues:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Dublin, <i>14 Aug., 1799</i>.</p>

<p>... I think Union gains ground. Lord Cornwallis is in earnest on the
subject and feels himself committed. The Catholics have been chiefly
courted by him, and he has always been of opinion that, if they would
act heartily in support, the Protestants would not resist the efforts of the
British Government, assisted by the population of the kingdom. I
believe this position to be true. It cannot, however, be fully acted upon,
in my mind, unless there be a determination to make <span class="ins" title="futher">further</span> concessions
to that body. To such concessions I confess I do not see insuperable,
tho' I do strong, objections. I think they vanish in the superior importance
of the question of Union. From the present state of the
country I conceive the question may be brought forward with safety.
If the Catholics were steady, Dublin might be preserved quiet, tho' the
Opposition would be clamorous. Our difficulties will be in Parliament.
I think the Speaker will not relax. Lord Downshire, I am sorry to say,
seems very hostile. Lord de Clifford is also unfriendly. Lord Donegal
I hear is coming round. Could Lord Downshire and Lord de Clifford
be made cordial, the Parliament would be secure. I see not any great
difficulty in settling the terms except as to the representation of the
Commons and compensation to the boroughs. Allowing two members
for each county&mdash;which makes 64&mdash;there is no principle which can be
exactly applied for classing the boroughs and selecting the great towns,
and tho' it would be easy to compensate the close boroughs, it is almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>impossible to compensate pot-walloping boroughs.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> The difficulties here
are enhanced by the consideration that in this case private not public
interests are concerned. When I thus represent the probability of success,
I am aware of the strange volatility of the Irish mind; and I should
not be surprised at any sudden turn of the present appearances....</p>
</div>


<p>Very interesting is the statement as to the courting of the
Catholics by Cornwallis. Pitt certainly knew of these advances;
for on New Year's Day 1801 Castlereagh reminded him by
letter that Cornwallis did not venture to make them until the
Cabinet had discussed the matter sometime in the autumn of
1799, and had come to a conclusion entirely favourable to the
Catholic claims, finally assuring him that he "need not hesitate in
calling forth the Catholic support in whatever degree he found it
practicable to obtain it." This and other passages in Castlereagh's
letter prove conclusively that not only Pitt, but the Cabinet as
a whole was responsible for the procedure of Cornwallis, which
ensured the more or less declared support of the Irish Catholics.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p>The chief difficulty was with the Protestant clique which largely
controlled State patronage. In the autumn Pitt had another interview
with Downshire, but found him full of complaints, demanding
among other things that Ireland should send at least 300
Commoners to Westminster. He departed for Dublin declaring
that he would do his duty. In October the Government's cause was
furthered by a state progress of Cornwallis through the North of
Ireland, during which he received numerous addresses in favour
of Union. At Belfast 150 of the chief citizens attended a banquet
in his honour; Londonderry was enthusiastic in the cause; and
it was clear that the opposition of the Protestants of the North
was slackening. But, as often happened in Ireland, many
Catholics now began to doubt the utility of a measure commended
by their opponents. The interest which Pitt felt in this
complex problem and in Cornwallis's tour appears in the following
Memorandum which he wrote probably at the end of October
1799:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>The number of placemen in Ireland is 71. Of these such as hold
office for life or during good behaviour, 11, and 2 holding places for
pleasure, vote against. It is said 63 seats have been vacated by Government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
by a misuse of the Place Bill. This number is exaggerated; but
at least 10 were vacated to serve Opposition. A charge is made against
Lord Cornwallis for canvassing for declarations in favour of Union.
The fact is that Lord Cornwallis, being commander-in-chief, thought it
his duty to make a progress of inspection thro' the kingdom in order to
examine the state of the army and to be a judge of the means of defence
he could rely on. In this progress he received numerous addresses
in favour of Union. A charge is made against Government of intimidation
and the exertion of martial law. There was only one attempt to
substantiate such a charge which was by Sir L. Parsons, which, instead
of terminating in censure, produced a vote of unanimous approbation in
favour of Government. There have been general charges of corruption
adduced, but no proof attempted. The charge retorted by Government
on Opposition for forming the most extensive subscriptions for the
purpose of corruption has not been denied by them.</p>
</div>


<p>The last sentence refers to a curious incident. Downshire, the
most influential opponent of the Union, had opened a fund for
influencing members of Parliament. It reached a large amount,
probably &pound;100,000. Beresford in a letter to Auckland states
that &pound;4,000 was paid to win over a supporter of Government.
Pitt, as we have seen, believed that Downshire's fund necessitated
the extensive use of bribery by Government. But it is on the
whole more likely that Dublin Castle opened the game by its
request early in 1799, for &pound;5,000 immediately from London.
Further sums were forwarded, for on 5th April, Cooke, after
interviews with Pitt and Portland, assured Castlereagh that
Portland would send "the needful" to Dublin. He adds: "Pitt
will contrive to let you have from &pound;8,000 to &pound;10,000 for five
years," though this was less than Castlereagh required. After
this, it is absurd to deny that Pitt used corrupt means to carry
the Union. He used them because only so could he carry
through that corrupt Parliament a measure entailing pecuniary
loss on most of its members. Probably he disliked the work as
much as Cornwallis, who longed to kick the men whom he had
to conciliate.&mdash;"I despise and hate myself every hour," so Cornwallis
wrote to Ross, "for engaging in such dirty work, and am
supported only by the reflection that without an Union, the
British Empire must be dissolved."<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span></p>
<p>The winter of 1799&ndash;1800 was marked by fierce discontent;
and again, after the rise of Bonaparte to power, there were
rumours of invasion which excited the peasants of South Ireland.
The men of Dublin on some occasions assaulted Unionist
Members of Parliament. Cornwallis, however, believed that the
country as a whole favoured the cause; and Castlereagh received
favourable assurances as to the attitude of the great majority of
Catholics except in County Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> Some leading Episcopalians
were appeased by the insertion of a clause uniting the
Protestant Churches of England and Ireland in one body. This
concession did not satisfy the Orangemen, who, despite the prohibition
of their Grand Lodge, clamoured against the Union, and
threatened to oppose it by force.</p>

<p>So doubtful were the omens when Cornwallis opened the Irish
Parliament on 5th February 1800, in a speech commending the
present plan of unification. Castlereagh then defended the proposals
and declared them to have the support of three fourths
of the property there represented. After showing the need of
keeping the debts of the two islands distinct, he explained that
an examination of the Customs and Excise duties warranted the
inference that the contribution of Ireland towards Imperial expenses
should be two fifteenths of that of Great Britain. He claimed
that this plan would press less heavily on Ireland than the present
duty of contributing &pound;1,000,000 to the British armaments
in time of war and half that amount in peace. Further, the
Union would tend to assuage religious jealousies and to consolidate
the strength of the Empire. Early on the next morning
the House divided&mdash;158 for and 115 against Government. This
result did not wholly please Dublin Castle. Cooke wrote on the
morrow to Auckland: "The activity and intimidation of Opposition,
together with their subscription purse, does sad mischief.
They scruple not to give from 3,000 to 4,000 guineas for a vote."
Government therefore had to mourn over seven deserters.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> Nevertheless,
this division was decisive. Castlereagh rounded up his
flock, and by the display of fat pasture called in some of the
wanderers. Is it possible that the Opposition purse was merely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>the device of a skilful auctioneer, who sends in a friend to raise
the bids?</p>

<p>The triumph of Government at Dublin had its effects at Westminster.
On 21st April 1800 Pitt explained the Resolutions as
recently accepted by the Irish Parliament. He spoke very briefly,
probably owing to ill health, which beset him through many
weeks of that year.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> He soon met a challenger. Thomas Jones
dared him to combat by accusing Ministers of seeking to disfranchise
Ireland by corrupt means. Foiled in argument, they
now acted on the principle</p>


<p class="poem" lang="la" style="font-style: normal">
Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo.
</p>


<p>After a further display of classical knowledge, Jones declared
that the introduction of 100 Irish members into that House
must destroy the British constitution, which, like Damocles,
would for ever be threatened with the sword of Dionysius suspended
over it by a single hair.</p>

<p>Disregarding rhetoric and classical allusions, Pitt plunged into
business. In none of his speeches is there a simpler statement
of a case. He declared the Union to be absolutely necessary as
a means of thwarting the machinations of an enemy ever intent
on separating the two kingdoms. It would further allay the
religious animosities rife in Ireland, and would conduce to her
freedom and happiness. He then uttered these words: "It may
be proper to leave to Parliament an opportunity of considering
what may be fit to be done for His Majesty's Catholic subjects,
without seeking at present any rule to govern the Protestant
Establishment or to make any provision upon that subject."
This statement is not wholly clear; but it and its context undoubtedly
opened up a prospect of Catholic Emancipation such
as Cornwallis had far more clearly outlined. The significance
of Pitt's declaration will appear in the sequel.</p>

<p>On the subject of commerce Pitt laid down the guiding principle
that after the Union all Customs barriers between the two
islands ought to be swept away as completely as between England
and Scotland. If at present they swerved from this grand
object, it was for the sake of reaching it the more surely. In
compliance with the demand of Ireland, they would allow her
to maintain a protective duty of 10 per cent. on cottons and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>woollens, in the latter case for not more than twenty years. He
then added these words: "The manufacturers of this country
do not, I believe, wish for any protecting duties; all they desire
is a free intercourse with all the world; and, though the want of
protecting duties may occasion partial loss, they think that
amply compensated by general advantage." No more statesmanlike
utterance had been heard in the House of Commons.
Only by degrees had Pitt worked his way to this conviction. In
his early Budgets, as we saw, he clung to the system of numerous
duties; but, despite the cramping influence of war, he now relied
on the effects of a two-shilling Income Tax and aimed at the
abolition of protective Customs dues. He was fated never to
reach this ideal; but there can be no doubt that he cherished it
as one of the hopes of his life.</p>

<p>Turning next to the question of Ireland's contribution to the
Imperial Exchequer, Pitt set forth his reasons for fixing it at
two fifteenths of the revenue of Great Britain; but, as this decision
might in the future unduly burden the smaller island, it
would not be final; and he suggested that at the end of twenty
years the resources of each would so far have developed as to
admit of a more authoritative assessment. If, however, in the
meantime the amount paid by Ireland should be in excess of
what ought to be paid, the surplus should be applied either
to the extinction of her Debt or to local improvements. He
further expressed the hope that in course of time the Debts and
the produce of taxation would be so far assimilated in the two
kingdoms as to admit of the formation of one National Debt
and one system of taxation. Despite the favourable nature of
these proposals, Pitt encountered a spirited opposition. Grey
declared the measure to be a gross violation of the rights of the
Irish people. Sheridan, Dr. Laurence (the friend of Burke), and
Tierney continued in the same strain; and Grey finally dared
the Minister to dissolve the Irish Parliament and appeal to the
people. Throwing off all signs of bodily weakness, Pitt took up
the challenge. Last year, he said, when the Commons of Ireland
rejected the Union, certain members applauded them.
Now, when they passed it, the same members said "appeal to
the people." He refused to do so, knowing well the scenes of
violence and intimidation that would result from consulting
primary assemblies of Irishmen. The reference to those bodies,
so notorious during the French Revolution, clinched his reply;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
and the House expressed approval of the Union by 236 votes
to 30 (21st April 1800).</p>

<p>The further debates on the Bill are of little interest. In the
absence of Fox, Grey was the protagonist of Opposition. Bankes,
once a firm supporter of Pitt, opposed the measure. Wilberforce
confessed to tremulous uncertainty about it, ostensibly because
the addition of 100 Irish members to the House would add to
the influence of the Crown, but more probably because he foresaw
Catholic Emancipation. Peel, already known as one of the
most successful and patriotic of Lancashire manufacturers, spoke
up manfully for the Union, though he deeply regretted that
Ireland would retain certain protective duties against Great
Britain. Very noteworthy, in view of the son's championship of
Free Trade in 1845, was the contention of the father that a weak
country (Ireland) had no need of "protection" against a stronger
one. In reality it would be as if a poor family shut its doors
against assistance from a wealthy one. On the trading proposals
Pitt's following was thinned down to 133; but the main question
went through in May by overwhelming majorities in both Houses.
In the following month it passed through the Irish Parliament.</p>

<p>Castlereagh thereupon introduced a Bill to indemnify the
holders of pocket boroughs who would lose patronage by the
proposed changes. The Government, having now revised its
previous resolve, proposed to disfranchise as many as 84 small
Irish boroughs, and allotted &pound;15,000 for each, or &pound;1,260,000 in
all. In explanation of this payment it must be remembered that
the owning of such boroughs was a recognized form of property,
as appeared in Pitt's proposal of 1785 to compensate British
owners whom he sought to dispossess. Nothing but the near
approach of revolution in 1832 availed to shatter the system of
pocket boroughs in Great Britain; and then their owners were
sent empty away. The difference in treatment marks the infiltration
of new ideas. In England and Ireland a vote and a seat had
been a form of property. According to the Rights of Man the
franchise was an inalienable right of citizenship.</p>

<p>The list of Union honours and preferments having been published,
we need not dwell on that unsavoury topic, except to
remark that the promotions in the peerage conferred for services
in connection with the Union numbered forty-six; that the
opposition of the Protestant Archbishop of Cashel was bought
off by the promise of the Archbishopric of Dublin; and that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
number of ecclesiastical jobs consequent on the Union was
nearly twenty. The promotions in the legal profession numbered
twelve. Twelve pensions and four titular honours were also
granted. Five aspirants refused the posts offered to them because
they expected "snug sinecures" which "require no attendance
at all." In March 1805 Lord Hardwicke, successor to Cornwallis,
complained that his funds were so embarrassed by the various
claims that the Irish Civil List had only &pound;150 in hand.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> These
sordid bargainings cannot be said to amount to wholesale corruption,
and did not much exceed those which usually were needed
to carry an important Bill through that Parliament. On the
whole Pitt and his colleagues might reflect with satisfaction that
the use of bribes served to cleanse the political life of Ireland in
the future.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Union of the British and Irish Parliaments is generally
considered from the insular point of view. This is quite natural;
for primarily it concerned the British Isles. Nevertheless the
influences which brought it about were more than insular. The
formation of the United Kingdom, by the Act which came into
effect on 1st January 1801, was but one among many processes
of consolidation then proceeding. France was the first State
which succeeded in concentrating political power at the capital;
and the new polity endued her with a strength sufficient to break
in pieces the chaotic systems of her neighbours. The mania
of the French for centralization was seen in their dealings with
the Batavian Republic, and with the Swiss Confederation, which
they crushed into the mould of an indivisible Republic. Everywhere
the new unifying impulse undermined or swept away
local Parliaments or provincial Estates. Liberty, Equality, and
Fraternity in practice meant a single, democratic, and centralized
Government. In self defence the Powers threatened by France
borrowed her political weapons. In succession Great Britain,
Prussia, and for a time even Austria, pulled themselves together
for the struggle. As the binding powers of commerce also tended
towards union, the Nineteenth Century witnessed the absorption
of little States, except where they represented a distinct
nationality.</p>

<p>Confronted by the new and threatening forces in France, Pitt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>was virtually compelled to abrogate a system under which the
Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, and Ministers who
had no definite responsibility, could meddle in military affairs.
Under the sway of Mars dualism cannot exist. In the crises of
a great war Cabals and Juntos go by the board. The Irish
Ministry was little more than a Junto; and Ireland need not
mourn its loss.</p>

<p>The loss of her Parliament was far more serious; and if that
body had represented the Irish people, Pitt's action would be indefensible.
But Grattan's Parliament represented only a small
minority of the Irish people; and that minority was resolved not
to admit Catholics to full civic rights. It would have fought to
maintain Protestant Episcopalian ascendancy; and under the
conditions then existing England must have drawn the sword on
behalf of her exacting "garrison."</p>

<p>Even in ordinary times such a state of things was unbearable;
and the French saw it. Their aim was to strike at England
through Ireland; and, but for Bonaparte's dreams of conquest
in the East, this blow would have been dealt. Fortunately for
Great Britain, his oriental ambitions served to divert to the
sands of Egypt a thunderbolt which would have been fatal at
Dublin. Even as it was, the mere presence of Bruix' great fleet
at Brest prolonged the ferment in Ireland, thus emphasizing the
force of the arguments in favour of Union. As we have seen,
Pitt placed them in the forefront of his speeches; and those who
charge him with hypocrisy, because France did not strike vigorously
at Ireland during or after the Rebellion of 1798, only expose
their ignorance of the facts and sentiments of that time.
Throughout the years 1799 and 1800 the thought of invasion
filled the minds of loyalists with dread, of malcontents with
eager hope.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Pitt saw in the Union, not merely an expedient
necessitated by war, but a permanent uplift for the whole nation.
From the not dissimilar case of the Union with Scotland he
augured hopefully for Ireland, believing that her commerce
would thrive not less than that of North Britain. Still more did
he found his hopes upon the religious settlement whereby he
sought to crown his work. Ever since the days of Queen Elizabeth
the strife between the Protestants and Catholics had marred
the fortunes of that land. Pitt believed that it could be stilled in
the larger political unity for which he now prepared.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="title spaced">RESIGNATION</p>

<p class="quote">It is well known that no quiet could subsist in a country where there is
not a Church Establishment.&mdash;<span class="smcap">George&nbsp;III to Addington</span>, <i>29th January
1801</i>.</p>


<p>On 25th September 1800 Pitt wrote to the Lord Chancellor,
Loughborough, then in attendance on the King at Weymouth,
requesting his presence at a Cabinet meeting in order to
discuss the Catholic Question and proposals respecting tithes
and a provision for the Catholic and Dissenting clergy. Five
days later he explained to his colleagues the main proposal. In
place of the Oaths of Supremacy and Abjuration he desired to
impose on members of Parliament and officials merely the Oath
of Allegiance, which would be no bar to Romanists. The change
won the approval of all the Ministers present except Loughborough.
He strongly objected to the proposal, upheld the
present exclusive system, and demurred to any change affecting
Roman Catholics except a commutation of tithes, a measure
which he had in preparation. His colleagues, astonished at this
firm opposition from the erstwhile Presbyterian of East Lothian,
begged him to elaborate his Tithe Bill, and indulged the hope
that further inquiry would weaken his resistance to the larger
Reform. They did not know Loughborough.</p>

<p>There is a curious reference in one of Pitt's letters, of October
1798, to Loughborough as the Keeper of the King's conscience.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>
The phrase has an ironical ring well suited to the character of
him who called it forth. Now, in his sixty-seventh year, he had
run through the gamut of political professions. An adept in the
art of changing sides, he, as Alexander Wedderburn, had earned
the contempt or envy of all rivals. Yet such was the grace of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>his curves and the skill of his explanations that a new turn
caused less surprise than admiration. Unlike his rival, Thurlow,
who stormed ahead, Wedderburn trimmed his sails for every
breeze and showed up best in light airs. Making few friends, he
had few inveterate enemies; but one of them, Churchill, limned
him as</p>


<p class="poem">
Adopting arts by which gay villains rise<br />
And reach the heights which honest men despise;<br />
Mute at the Bar and in the Senate loud,<br />
Dull 'mong the dullest, proudest of the proud,<br />
A pert prim prater of the northern race,<br />
Guilt in his heart, and famine in his face.<br />
</p>


<p>This was before Wedderburn had wormed himself into favour
with Lord North and won the office of Solicitor-General (1778).
Two years later he became Lord Loughborough, a title which
Fox ascribed to his rancorous abuse of the American colonists.
Figuring next as a member of the Fox&ndash;North Administration, he
did not long share the misfortunes of his colleagues, for he alone
of his colleagues contrived not to offend either the King or Pitt.
This sleekness had its reward. The perversities of Thurlow
having led to his fall in 1792, Loughborough became Lord Chancellor.
His sage counsels heightened his reputation; and in
October 1794 Pitt assigned to him the delicate task of seeing
Earl Fitzwilliam and Grattan in order to smooth over the difficulties
attending the union with the Old Whigs. At his house
in Bedford Square, Bloomsbury, occurred some of the conferences
which ensured Fitzwilliam's acceptance of the Irish
Viceroyalty. Loughborough urged Pitt to do all in his power to
prevent a rupture with the Portland Whigs or the Irish people.
Counsels of conciliation then flowed from his lips and were
treasured up. In fact, Pitt seems to have felt no suspicion of him
despite his courtier-like ways and his constant attendance on the
King. For Loughborough, like Dundas, had outlived the evil
reputation of an earlier time. The Marquis of Buckingham,
writing to Grenville on an awkward episode affecting Lord
Berkeley, advised him to consult Loughborough as a man of
discretion and undoubted private honour.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>Neither Pitt nor Grenville knew that Loughborough had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>played them false in 1795. The man who urged them to send
Fitzwilliam to Dublin with the olive-branch soon tendered to
George&nbsp;III official advice of an exactly opposite tenour, namely,
that assent to Catholic Emancipation would involve a violation
of the Coronation Oath. A day or two later he stated to Rose
that he had given to the King wholly different counsels, to the
effect that the Coronation Oath did not apply to the question at
issue, which referred to a legislative enactment, not to an act of
the King in his executive capacity.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> Two other legal authorities
unequivocally declared for this view of the case.</p>

<p>Whether in the autumn and winter of 1800 Loughborough's
secret counsels had much effect on the King may be doubted;
for George, in his letter of 6th February 1795 to Pitt, declared
Catholic Emancipation to be "beyond the decision of any
Cabinet of Ministers." As for the Church Establishment, it was
essential to every State, and must be maintained intact. When
George had once framed a resolve, it was hopeless to try to
change it. Moreover, during the debates on the Union, early in
1799, he remarked to Dundas at Court that he hoped the Cabinet
was not pledged to anything in favour of the Romanists. "No,"
was the wary reply, "that will be a matter for future consideration."
Thereupon he set forth his scruples respecting the Coronation
Oath. Dundas sought to allay them by observing that the
Oath referred, not to his executive actions, but only to his assent
to an act of the Legislature, a matter even then taken for granted.
The remark, far from soothing the King, elicited the shrewd
retort, "None of your Scotch metaphysics, Mr. Dundas! None of
your Scotch metaphysics!"</p>

<p>The action of Loughborough, then, can only have put an edge
on the King's resolve; and all speculation as to the exact nature
of his "intrigues" at Weymouth or at Windsor is futile. In
truth a collision between the King and Pitt on this topic was
inevitable. The marvel is that there had been no serious friction
during the past eighteen years. Probably the knowledge that a
Fox Cabinet, dominated by the Prince of Wales, was the only
alternative to Pitt had exerted a chastening influence on the
once headstrong monarch; but now even that spectre faded
away before the more potent wraith of mangled Protestantism.
The King was a sincerely religious man in his own narrow way;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>and arguments about the Coronation Oath were as useless with
him as discussions on Modernism are with Pius&nbsp;X.</p>

<p>Pitt therefore kept his plans secret. But we must here digress
to notice an assertion to the contrary. Malmesbury avers that
Loughborough, while at Weymouth in the autumn of 1800,
informed his cousin, Auckland, and the Archbishop of Canterbury
of the danger to the Established Church; that the latter
wrote to the King, who thereupon upbraided Pitt. Now, it is
highly probable that Auckland knew nothing of the matter until
the end of January 1801,<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> and the secret almost certainly did
not come to light until then, when the Archbishop, Auckland's
brother-in-law, was a prey to nervous anxieties resulting from
recent and agitating news. Further, no such letter from the
King to Pitt is extant either at the Public Record Office,
Orwell Park, or Chevening; and if the proposals were known
to George why did he fume at Pitt and Castlereagh on 28th
January for springing the mine upon him? Finally, if the King,
while at Weymouth, blamed Pitt for bringing the matter forward,
why did Malmesbury censure him for keeping it secret?
It is well to probe these absurdities, for they reveal the untrustworthiness
of the Earl on this question.</p>

<p>To revert to Pitt's procedure; there were two arguments on
which he must have relied for convincing the King of the need
of granting Catholic Emancipation. Firstly, the Irish Catholics
had, on the whole, behaved with marked loyalty and moderation
during the wearisome debates on the Union at Dublin, a course
of conduct markedly different from the acrid and factious tactics
of the privileged Protestant Episcopalians. Secondly, as the
summer of 1800 waned to autumn, the position of Great Britain
became almost desperate. Her ally, Austria, had lost Lombardy
and was fighting a losing game in Swabia. Russia had not only
left the Second Coalition, but was threatening England with a
renewal of the Armed Neutrality League. At home a bad harvest
was sending up corn to famine prices; and sedition again raised
its head. In such a case would not a patriotic ruler waive his
objections to a measure essential not only to peace and quiet in
Ireland, but to the stability of the United Kingdom? The latter
consideration derived added force from the fact that Bonaparte,
fresh from his triumphs in Italy, was inaugurating a policy of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>conciliation which promised to end the long ferment in the west
of France and to make of her a really united nation. While he
was allaying Jacobinical zeal and royalist bigotry, could Britons
afford to keep up internal causes of friction, and, disunited
among themselves, face a hostile world in arms? In such an
emergency would not the King waive even his conscientious
scruples, and at the cost of some qualms pacify and consolidate
his nominally united realms?</p>

<p>For it was certain that the Irish Catholics would not rest now
that the boon of Emancipation was well within reach. Pitt and
Cornwallis had aroused their hopes. While not openly promising
that the portals at Westminster should be thrown open to
Roman Catholics, Ministers had allowed hints to go forth
definite enough to influence opinion, especially in Cork, Tipperary,
and Galway. In fact, Castlereagh assured Pitt that the
help of Catholics had turned the wavering scales in favour of
Union.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> The claims of honour therefore required that Pitt should
do all in his power to requite the services of a great body of men,
long depressed and maligned, who, when tempted by the foreigner
to revolt, had on the whole shown remarkable patience and
fidelity. The pressure of this problem was too much for the
scanty strength of Pitt. Worried by private financial needs, and
distressed at the bewildering change in European affairs, he broke
down in health in September&ndash;October; and a period of rest
and change at Addington's seat at Woodley, near Reading, was
all too short for a complete recovery (18th October to 5th November).
Addington, describing this visit, remarked that Pitt
had become one of his family. Neither of them knew that a time
of feud was at hand.</p>

<p>At the close of the year Castlereagh came from Dublin to
London to confer with Ministers on legal and other details connected
with the proposal of Catholic Emancipation. By that
time Loughborough's sharp opposition to the measure was
known at Dublin Castle, where Cornwallis declared all resistance
to the measure to be mere madness. The Catholics, he
reported, were quiet merely because they were confident of success.
Cooke, though once opposed to Catholic Emancipation, now
accepted it as a necessity.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> Nevertheless in the King's view
Catholic Emancipation was wholly incompatible with his Coronation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
Oath and with the Church Establishment in England. In
the middle of December the Chancellor drew up an able and
very detailed Memorandum on the legal aspects of the case. He
even discoursed on the proselytizing zeal of Romanists and the
material causes of discontent in Ireland which the Union would
probably dispel. As Cooke remarked, the paper seemed designed
to close the question for ever.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></p>

<p>Pitt was equally determined to set the question at rest. He
and Castlereagh had confidence in the issue; and Cornwallis
declared that if Pitt were firm he would meet with no difficulty.
Accordingly Pitt inserted in the King's Speech for the ensuing
session a passage expressing confidence that Parliament would
seek to improve the benefits already secured by the Act of
Union. The phrase was smooth enough to leave the King's
conscience unruffled, and on 23rd January he assented to the
Speech, requesting that no change be made.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> But while Pitt
sapped the approaches to the citadel, Loughborough countermined
him. On what day and in what manner he informed
the King of the proposed measure of Catholic Emancipation is
not clear. Possibly George scented mischief in a short conversation
with Spencer and Grenville about the middle of
January. But his brain was set on fire by something which he
heard on 27th or 28th January. On the latter day (Wednesday),
during the <span lang="fr">lev&eacute;e</span> at St. James's Palace, his behaviour betrayed
unusual excitement, and he said warmly to Windham, a friend
of the measure, that he regarded all supporters of it as "personally
indisposed" to him. Waxing hotter in the course of the
function, he declared in a loud voice to Dundas: "What is this
that the young Lord [Castlereagh] has brought over, which they
are going to throw at my head? Lord C. came over with the
plan in September.... I shall reckon any man my personal
enemy who proposes any such measure. The most Jacobinical
thing I ever heard of."</p>

<p>This extraordinary outburst naturally led Ministers to confer
together on the morrow; and they requested Grenville to prepare
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>a paper explaining the proposed changes in the form of oath for
members of Parliament and officials. Grenville declined this
task, which Pitt himself then undertook. This question, I may
note, was far more difficult than outsiders could understand.
Castlereagh's interviews with Pitt in September, and now again
in January, had only recently brought Ministers near to an agreement,
a fact which fully accounts for the delay in drafting the
proposals in a form suitable for the King's inspection.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> On that
day George took another step betokening irrevocable opposition.
He begged Addington to see Pitt and convince him of
the danger of the measure. The King confessed that he could
scarcely keep his temper in speaking about it; for it portended
the destruction of the Established Church and the end of all
order in civil life. Addington therefore paid a visit to Pitt, who
cannot have been well pleased to see him acting as a tool of the
King. The interview, however, seems to have been friendly,
and it inspired Addington with the complacent hope that he
had dissuaded Pitt. Possibly he or Auckland alarmed Dr. Moore,
Archbishop of Canterbury, and set the bishops in motion.
Other persons working to this end were the Earl of Clare and
the Irish Primate. The latter took a prominent part in arousing
the fears of the King. Cooke wrote: "The Primate was a great
card, was much consulted by the King, for ever with him, or
in correspondence with him.... The Archbishop of Canterbury
was at first so nervous that for ten or twelve nights he
could not sleep, and our Primate was daily with him, encouraging
him."<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p>It is uncertain how far Pitt was aware of the many adverse
influences playing upon the King; for his papers on this topic
are unusually scanty. On the 30th he sent a draft of his proposals
to Loughborough, a sign that he would persevere with them.
On the morrow George again summoned Addington to the
palace, and adjured him to form a Ministry. This offer preceded
the arrival of any intimation from Pitt of his desire to resign if
his advice were rejected. Addington for his part begged to be
excused; whereupon the King exclaimed: "Lay your hand
upon your heart and ask yourself where I am to turn for support
if <em>you</em> do not stand by me."<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> Meanwhile Pitt was inditing his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>famous letter of 31st January, to the King, of which this summary
must suffice:</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>Pitt has heard with deep regret of the opposition displayed by His
Majesty to the proposals of Catholic Emancipation, which are approved
by the majority of the Cabinet and regarded as a natural sequel to the
Act of Union. The admission of Catholics and Dissenters to certain
offices, and of Catholics to Parliament, now involves little or no danger
to the Established Church or to the Protestant interest, as the Catholics
disclaim the obnoxious tenets once held by them. A form of oath can
be devised to exclude those Dissenters who may have designs against
the constitution either in Church or State. The Irish Catholic clergy
may be attached to the Government by making their maintenance partly
dependent on the State. These changes would adapt the constitution to
present needs. Pitt therefore earnestly commends the measure to the
consideration of His Majesty. Meanwhile no steps will be taken in the
matter; but, if on examination the measure should not be approved,
Pitt will beg to be allowed to resign, though in such a way as to occasion
the least possible difficulty. Finally he takes the liberty "of most
respectfully, but explicitly, submitting to Your Majesty the indispensable
necessity of effectually discountenancing, in the whole of the interval,
all attempts to make use of Your Majesty's name, or to influence the
opinion of any individual on any part of the subject."</p>
</div>


<p>In the last sentence Pitt administered a telling and dignified
rebuke for the outrageous behaviour of the King at the <span lang="fr">lev&eacute;e</span>. A
reply came on the morrow, couched in pompously ungrammatical
terms, which sufficiently refute the rumour that it was composed
by that polished talker, Loughborough. George declared
that his Oath bound him to support the Established Church;
that State officials must be in active communion with that
Church. He therefore refused to discuss the present proposals,
which tended to destroy the groundwork of the Constitution.
Respecting the suggested truce of silence he wrote as follows:
"Mr. Pitt once acquainted with my sentiments, his assuring
me that he will stave off the only question whereon I fear from
his letter we can never agree&mdash;for the advantage and comfort of
continuing to have his advice and exertions in public affairs I
will certainly abstain from talking on this subject which is the
one nearest my heart." The meaning of these words is not easy
to fix; but apparently the King meant to say that his silence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>on the subject was conditional on Pitt promising never to bring
it forward again. Now, Pitt had made no such promise. He
required that, while the King was examining the proposals of his
Cabinet, he would abstain from setting his counsellors against
it. George&nbsp;III evaded this request, thereby leaving himself free
to talk at large against Catholic Emancipation while he was
supposed to be examining its details. We may be sure that this
sentence clinched Pitt's resolve to resign at the earliest possible
moment.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p>

<p>He said so in his reply of 3rd February to the King. He expressed
both regret at the King's resolve on this question, and a
desire to consult his convenience, though continuance in office
even for a short time became very difficult in view of the King's
refusal to undertake to discountenance the use of his name
during the interval. In every respect the accession of another
Minister was to be desired. Pitt closed this painful correspondence
with a letter, also of 3rd February, requesting a pension of
&pound;1,500 a year for Long, one of the secretaries of the Treasury,
whose private means were so slender as to leave him in discomfort
if he should resign. The King briefly assented to Pitt's
retirement and to Long's pension. To Long's services the King
accorded a few words of thanks: to those of Pitt not a word.
This is the more remarkable as Pitt was then suffering from an
attack of gout which depressed him greatly; but, as we shall
see, the King in private expressed his deep obligations, and
requested him to keep in office until all the new appointments
were settled.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> This involved a delay of nearly six weeks, which
were among the most trying of his career.</p>

<p>On 5th February the King succeeded in persuading Addington
to form a Ministry. Accordingly on the 10th he resigned
the office of Speaker, being succeeded by Sir John Mitford,
afterwards Lord Redesdale. There is no ground for the insinuation
that Addington snatched at office. He took it without
eagerness but from conscientious conviction; and Pitt, with the
usual generosity of his nature, assured him of his support as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>private member. Of Pitt's colleagues Grenville, Dundas, Spencer,
and Windham offered their resignations; so also did Cornwallis
and Castlereagh at Dublin. Portland retained the Home
Secretaryship. Of late he had wavered on the subject of Catholic
Emancipation, perhaps owing to the arguments of Loughborough.
Westmorland and Chatham also kept their positions
of Lord Privy Seal and Lord President. The retention of office
by the latter aroused some comment; but as the earnest desire
of Pitt was to disarrange the Ministry as little as possible, he
probably approved conduct which outsiders condemned as unbrotherly.</p>

<p>The following letter from Chatham, dated Winchester, 6th
February, is of interest. After expressing his regret at Pitt's
resignation, he continues: "Upon the measure itself of granting
further indulgence to the Catholics I have neither time, nor
indeed would it be of any use, to say anything at present. I
will only observe that if, by being on the spot, I could in any
degree have contributed even to put off the extremity to which
the agitation of it has led, I should think I had done much, and
I should be most unhappy in having been absent; otherwise I
consider myself as fortunate in having avoided a discussion
which could only have been painful to me in many respects. As
things stand, I shall certainly think it my duty to come to town
in a few days, and I will defer, till we meet, any further remarks;
I will only add that if your part is irrevocably taken, the King
could not have acted more wisely than in having recourse to the
Speaker.... I see all the difficulty and delicacy of your situation."<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

<p>Far less charitable were the sentiments of Dundas in the following
letter:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Wimbledon, <i>7 Feb., 1801</i>.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<p>I know not to what stage the Speaker's endeavours to form an Arrangement
have proceeded; but it is impossible for me not to whisper into
your ear my conviction that no Arrangement can be formed under him
as its head that will not crumble to pieces almost as soon as formed.
Our friends who, as an act of friendship and attachment to you agree to
remain in office, do it with the utmost chagrin and unwillingness; and
among the other considerations which operate upon them the feeling
that they are embarking in an Administration under a head totally incapable
to carry it on and which must of course soon be an object of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>ridicule is uppermost in their minds. Add to this that, though they will
not certainly enter into faction and opposition, all the aristocracy of the
country at present cordially connected with Government, and part of it
under you, feel a degradation in the first Minister of the Country being
selected from [<span lang="la">sic</span>] a Person of the description of Mr. Addington without
the slightest pretensions to justify it, and destitute of abilities to
carry it on. Depend upon it I am not exaggerating the state of the case;
and a very short experience will prove that I am right; and the Speaker
will ere long feel that he has fallen from a most exalted situation and
character into one of a very opposite description. Save him from it if
not too late. Yourself excluded from it, I am afraid nothing permanent
can be formed; but if the Speaker was to advise the King to call upon
the Duke of Portland to form an Administration, I am persuaded His
Grace at the head of it, with either Steele, Ryder, Lord Hawkesbury, or
even Mr. Abbott as his Chancellor of the Exchequer, would fill the
public eye infinitely more than anything that can be found upon the
plan now in agitation. By the answer I have received from the King to
my resignation I must entreat you without delay to send for my correspondence
with Lord Westmorland in order that I may be sure of what
my recollection suggests, that I refused to give the promise of the
Government at home that what was then proposed was the ultimatum
of concession.</p>
</div>


<p>The last sentence of Chatham's letter refers to the difficulties
of Pitt's position. These have nearly always been overlooked.
Yet his decision turned finally on a question of honour. It is
true that neither Pitt nor Cornwallis gave a distinct pledge to
the Irish Catholics that the Cabinet would press their claims
if they would support the Union. But no such pledge could
have been given without exasperating the King and the privileged
phalanx at St. Stephen's Green. Therefore, when the
critics of Pitt demand to see the proof that he made a promise,
they ask for what, in the nature of the case, could not be forthcoming.
Cornwallis and Castlereagh were aware of the need of
extreme caution in making overtures to the leading Catholics;
and they afterwards denied that they gave a distinct pledge.
Nevertheless, some of their agents induced the Catholics of the
south and west of Ireland, to act in a "highly useful" manner,
which averted an otherwise dangerous opposition. Castlereagh
explained this to Pitt early in January;<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> and the scrupulous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>Minister must have considered these promises as a debt of
honour. That some of the leading Irish Catholics viewed them
in the same light appears in an account of a representative
meeting held at Ryan's house in Marlborough Street, Dublin,
on 27th October 1804. Ryan then set forth the condition of
his co-religionists at the time of the Union, and referred to the
stipulations made to them by Government. Others, including
Lord Fingall and a barrister, Scully, followed; and after two
more meetings, they resolved to petition Pitt, who had by that
time returned to office, it being known that he was at heart
favourable to their claims.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> But in his speech of 14th May 1805
on this topic, he said, "I did not make a distinct pledge. On
the contrary, I believe the line of argument I took was, that if
it should be thought right to give what the Catholics required,
it might be given with more safety to the Empire."<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a></p>

<p>What the stipulations were is not clear; for with this exception
the Irish Records are disappointingly silent. But it is clear that
Canning finally came to consider them binding on an honourable
man. In his great speech on Catholic Emancipation in
March 1827, while admitting that Pitt in 1800 made no definite
promise to the Catholics, he added these notable words: "The
Catholics were made to believe, and that belief was a powerful
inducement to them to lend their aid towards the accomplishment
of the measure [the Union] that in the Imperial Parliament
the question which so nearly concerned them would be more
favourably entertained.... There is no tribunal, however solemn,
before which I am not prepared to depose to my firm belief in
the sincerity of Mr. Pitt's wishes and intentions to carry it."
This passage once for all refutes the charges of insincerity which
certain of Canning's biographers have brought against Pitt.</p>

<p>Light is thrown on this topic by notes of Bishop Tomline. Pitt
consulted his former tutor at this crisis; for on 6th February he
wrote warning him of his approaching resignation on grounds
which he desired to explain. He added: "I am in the firm persuasion
that an Arrangement can be formed to which I can give
a cordial general support, and which may keep everything safe."<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>
The bishop thereupon came to town and saw much of Pitt,
whose conduct he thus describes: "I never saw Mr. Pitt in more
uniformly cheerful spirits, although everyone about him was dejected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
and melancholy. He talked of his quitting office with the
utmost composure, gave the King the highest credit for the
notions on which he acted, and also fully acquitted those who
were supposed to have influenced his sentiments and conduct.
He felt some dissatisfaction at the conduct of one who was <em>not</em> a
Cabinet Minister, and was under great obligations to Mr. Pitt, who
had by intrigues and misrepresentations and every unfair means
in his power endeavoured to influence people's opinion on the
question and to excite alarm and prejudice against him." The
reference here is to Lord Auckland, but nothing definite is
known as to his conduct. The bishop then states that Pitt's
equanimity was surprising, inasmuch as his resignation would
reduce his income to less than that of a country gentleman and
necessitate the sale of Holwood. Nevertheless, no hasty word
fell from him even in the most confidential conversation; but
he talked cheerfully of living in privacy for the rest of his life,
and expressed satisfaction that men who were attached to the
constitution would carry on affairs of State. The safety of the
country seemed to be his only concern. Tomline then describes
the cause and the circumstances of Pitt's resignation:<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>While the business of the Union was going on, Lord Cornwallis had
informed the Ministers in England that the support of the Catholics to
the measure would in a great degree depend upon the intention of
Ministers to remove those disabilities under which they at present
laboured. This produced in the Cabinet a discussion of the question of
Catholic Emancipation, as it is called, and Lord Cornwallis was authorized
to declare that it was intended by Government, after the Union
should have taken place, to grant to the Catholics some further indulgences;
but he was not authorized to pledge the Government to any
particular measure, nor was any plan of this kind settled by the Cabinet.
When the King's Speech was to be drawn up for the opening of the
Imperial Parliament, the Catholic Question naturally occurred and gave
rise to a good deal of discussion in the Cabinet. Mr. Pitt, Lord Grenville,
Lord Spencer, Mr. Dundas, and Mr. Wyndham declared themselves
in favour of Catholic Emancipation; and the Lord Chancellor,
the Duke of Portland and Lord Westmorland against it. Lord Chatham
and Lord Liverpool did not attend the Council, the former being at
Winchester as military commander of that district and the latter was
confined to his house by illness.</p>

<p>The King was of course informed of this division in the Cabinet and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>took a decided part by talking against the question freely and openly to
everyone he saw. On Wednesday, the 28th of January, the King said to
Mr. D[undas] at the <span lang="fr">lev&eacute;e</span> in such a voice that those who were near
might hear him&mdash;"So here is an Irish Secretary come over to propose
in Parliament the Emancipation of the Irish Catholics, as they call it"&mdash;and
then he declared himself in the strongest degree hostile to the question.
This was of course reported to Mr. Pitt. On the Friday (the 30th)
the King sent for the Speaker to the Queen's House and conversed with
him a long time. Upon my mentioning this circumstance to Mr. Pitt,
he said he knew what happened at that interview and seemed perfectly
satisfied with it. He had before told me (namely, the first night he saw
me, Saturday, Feb. 7th) that he knew nine days before that he should
be under the necessity of resigning. On the 31st Mr. Pitt wrote his first
letter to the King. Two letters only passed on each side, which see.
Mr. Pitt did not see the King till at the <span lang="fr">lev&eacute;e</span> on Wednesday the 11th
[February]. The King spoke to him in the most gracious manner&mdash;"You
have behaved like yourself throughout this business. Nothing
could possibly be more honourable. I have a great deal more to say to
you."&mdash;"Your Majesty has already said much more than the occasion
calls for."&mdash;"Oh no, I have not; and I do not care who hears me: it
was impossible for anyone to behave more honourably." After more
conversation of the same kind the King desired to see Mr. Pitt in the
closet. The <span lang="fr">lev&eacute;e</span> continued, and, some little time after, Mr. Pitt said to
the King: "Your Majesty will pardon me if I take the liberty of saying
that I fear I shall not be able to attend Your Majesty in the closet."&mdash;"Oh
yes: you must; I have just done." The King went to the closet
and Mr. Pitt attended him. Nothing could exceed the kindness of the
King towards Mr. Pitt: he was affected very much and more than once.
The conversation lasted more than half an hour; and in the course of it
the King said that, tho' he could no longer retain Mr. Pitt in his service,
he hoped to have him as his friend. Mr. Pitt, with strong expressions
both of duty and attachment and love to His Majesty, submitted that
any intercourse of that kind might be injurious to His Majesty's Government;
for that it was very important that his new Ministers should
appear to act by themselves and for themselves, and that if he was
frequently with His Majesty, unfavourable conclusions might be drawn
concerning his interference or influence. This seemed to satisfy the
King, and they parted. At the <span lang="fr">lev&eacute;e</span> the King spoke in the highest terms
of Mr. Pitt's conduct throughout the business of his resignation, and
said that it was very different from that of his predecessors.</p>
</div>


<p>This narrative needs little comment, except on the phrase that
the Cabinet had promised to grant the Catholics "some further
indulgences." Probably the schism occurred on the extent of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
those concessions, Pitt and the majority desiring the admission
of Catholics to Parliament and to offices of trust, while Loughborough
and the minority refused to do more than grant some
measure of support to the Irish priests.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> The King probably
opposed both concessions; and Pitt seems to have ascribed his
strenuous opposition more to the intrigues of Auckland than to
those of Loughborough. In this he was probably mistaken.
The best judge on this question, the monarch himself, certainly
looked on the Chancellor as a traitor. But in truth the crisis
could not be avoided. The King acknowledged as much in his
effusive comments on the extremely honourable conduct of
Pitt, but he also most firmly declared that he could no longer
retain him in his service. This was in effect a dismissal. On
18th February, George wrote a brief letter expressing his sorrow
at the close of Pitt's political career and his satisfaction that
Parliament had passed the Ways and Means without debate.
Thus did he close his correspondence with a Minister who had
devotedly served him for more than seventeen years.</p>

<hr />

<p>There is little need to notice the hasty and spiteful comments
of Lord Malmesbury, that Pitt was playing a selfishly criminal
game by resigning, with the evident aim of showing his own
strength and being called back to office on his own terms.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> The
Malmesbury Diaries at this point consist chiefly of hearsays,
which can readily be refuted. But this calumny spread widely,
and Fox finally barbed it with the hint that the substitution of
Addington for Pitt was "a notorious juggle," the former being
obviously a dummy to be knocked down when it suited Pitt
to come back fancy-free about the Catholics. Fortunately, the
correspondence of statesmen often supplies antidotes to the
venomous gibes of bystanders; and a case in point is a phrase
in Grenville's letter of 13th February to Minto: "There was no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>alternative except that of taking this step [resignation] or of
agreeing to the disguise or dereliction of one's opinion on one
of the most important questions in the whole range of our
domestic policy."<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

<p>Pitt has been sharply censured for his excessive scrupulousness
in resigning at so serious a crisis. But the verdict must
depend on three main issues, the importance of the question at
stake, that of the services rendered by the Irish Catholics, and
the nature of the promises made to them. Now, no one will deny
that in the days when France was striving to effect the independence
of Ireland&mdash;for Bonaparte was thought to be pressing
on the war with that aim in view<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>&mdash;the question of the Union
stood paramount. It was the most important problem confronting
Parliament since the Union with Scotland in 1707; and the
difficulties encountered were greater than those raised by the
Scots. The services of the Irish Catholics to the cause of the
Union are not easy to assess; but Castlereagh, a cool judge,
rated them high. In such a case a man of sensitive conscience
will deem himself bound to those who, in reliance on his sense
of honour, acted in a way that ensured the success of his measure.
Above all, in so tangled a situation the final decision will depend
on the character of the statesman. Walpole would have waived
aside the debt of honour. Pitt resolved to discharge it.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to notice another slander, that Pitt
resigned because, in his inability to procure peace from France,
he intended to put Addington in office merely for that purpose,
to be ousted when it was fulfilled. No evidence is forthcoming
in support of this version, which found no small favour with
Continental historians of a former generation; but it is now clear
that the split occurred solely on Catholic Emancipation. Those
Ministers who approved it resigned; while its opponents remained
in office, namely, Portland, Chatham, and Westmorland.
The same is true of the subordinate offices. The new Cabinet
decided to grant only occasional relief and a "compassionate
allowance" to the Irish priests.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> In several other matters its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>policy differed from that of Pitt; and Addington soon made it
apparent that he was no stop-gap.</p>

<p>But now this clear issue was to be blurred in the blinding
glare of the King's lunacy. The causes of the malady of
February 1801 were partly physical, partly mental. While still
agitated by the dismissal of his trusted Minister, the King, two
days later, went to church on the day appointed for the National
Fast. That day of supplication for delivery from the perils of
the time was shrouded in gloom and snow. He remained a long
time in church and took a chill. Nevertheless, with his wonted
energy he persisted in transacting business with Addington,
until the stress told on the brain. On the 16th slight feverish
symptoms began to develop. Yet Addington saw him often
about new appointments, until on Sunday the 22nd the symptoms
caused some concern. Willis, son of the man who had so
much control over him during the illness of 1788&ndash;9, now came to
the Queen's House, and resumed the old regimen. Dr. Gisborne
was also in attendance. From the notes of Tomline we glean
curious details about the illness. The bilious symptoms were
very pronounced, and after the 23rd the King became worse.
His manner became nervous and "hurried." He went up to
Willis and shook him eagerly by the hand. When the Queen
and princesses rose to leave, he jocosely extended his arms so
as to stop them; whereupon Willis stepped forward, and, looking
at him earnestly, told him he was very ill. The King at once
said with a deep sigh: "I see, I cannot deceive you. I have
deceived all the rest. They think me well; but I cannot deceive
you." He then burst into an agony of weeping, threw himself
into Willis's arms, and said: "You are right. I am ill indeed.
But oh! for God's sake, keep your father from me, and keep off
a Regency."</p>

<p>After weeping for a quarter of an hour, he walked about the
room with Willis for an hour and a half. In the evening he
grew worse. At 2.30 a.m. he went to bed, while the Duke of
Kent and Willis watched by the door. As in the previous
seizure, intervals of calm and reasonableness alternated strangely
with fits of delirium or even of violence. Now and again he spoke
collectedly, and at such times those about him rejoiced to hear
the familiar "What, what," wherewith he prefaced his remarks.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span></p>
<p>Frequently he declared that he would uphold the Church of
England; or again his thoughts started away from the loathed
spectre of a Regency. On 2nd March the illness took so violent
a turn that his life seemed in danger; but, as was the case twelve
years before, long spells of sleep supervened and brought his
pulse down from 136 to 84. His powers of recovery surprised
every one about him. By 6th March he was so far well as to be
allowed to see the Dukes of York, Kent, and Cumberland. Not
until 9th March did he undergo the more trying ordeal of seeing
the Prince of Wales. On that same day he requested to see Pitt,
who very properly declined, suggesting, with all deference, that
Addington was the proper person for an interview.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, at or just after the crisis of the illness, Pitt gave
a very important pledge. If we may trust the far from convincing
statements of Lord Malmesbury, who had the story from
Pelham, the King on 7th March charged Willis to inform Pitt
of the improvement in his health, and to add the biting words:
"But what has not <em>he</em> to answer for who is the cause of my
having been ill at all?" Pelham further asserted that Pitt, in a
"most dutiful, humble and contrite answer," wrote down his
resolve to give up Catholic Emancipation.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> Now it is almost
certain that Pitt sent no such letter, for none exists either at
the Public Record Office, Orwell Park, or Chevening. Tomline
asserts that Pitt sent by Willis a verbal assurance that he would
not agitate Catholic Emancipation again during the King's reign;
whereupon George&nbsp;III exclaimed: "Now my mind will be at
ease." The bishop, however, believed that Pitt's assurance was
reported in a more emphatic form than was warranted; and the
statesman does not seem to have considered himself absolutely
bound by it. Yet the written assurance sent by Rose to the
King on behalf of Pitt seems binding during that reign.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<p>Thus had the King conquered&mdash;by madness. No incident in
the life of Pitt is more unfortunate than this surrender. The
King had made an ungenerous use of the privileges of an invalid,
and the pressure which he put on Pitt passes the bounds even
of the immorality of a sick-room. The illness began with a chill
due to his own imprudence; but he used its later developments
to extort a promise which otherwise would never have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>forthcoming. Nothing but the crisis in the King's illness led
Pitt to waver. For at the end of February he authorized
Castlereagh to send to Cornwallis at Dublin a declaration
intended to reassure the Irish Catholics. It pointed out that
the majority of the Cabinet had resigned owing to the impossibility
of carrying Catholic Emancipation at the present juncture.
He (Pitt) still resolved to do his utmost for the success
of that cause; and therefore begged them to refrain from any
conduct which would prejudice it in the future. Cornwallis
delivered this and another paper to the titular Archbishop of
Dublin and Lord Fingall for circulation among their friends and
found that it produced good results.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> Far different, of course,
was the effect produced on those few who knew of Pitt's private
promise to the King. They contrasted it with the contrary
promise to the Irish Catholics and drew the most unfavourable
inferences, forgetting that between 27th February and 2nd March
the King's illness had taken so dangerous a turn as perhaps to
justify the use of that political sedative.</p>

<p>While blaming Pitt for weakness in giving this pledge to the
King, we must remember that the prolongation of the reign of
George&nbsp;III was the first desire of all responsible statesmen.
The intrigues of the Prince of Wales and Fox for a Regency
were again beginning; and thus there loomed ahead an appalling
vista of waste and demoralization. In these circumstances
Dundas and Cornwallis came to the conclusion that the King's
conscience must not again be troubled. Grenville seems to have
held firm on the Catholic Question.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> But his colleagues now
took an opportunist view. Pitt had two or three interviews
with the Prince of Wales, late in February and early in March,
and made it clear that the Prince would be well advised to
accept the Regency Bill drafted in 1789. On the Prince asking
whether this was the opinion of certain of Pitt's colleagues, who
then opposed that Bill as derogatory to his interests, Pitt at
once replied in the affirmative; and when the Prince further
objected to certain restrictions on the power of the Regent, Pitt
declared that no change would be acceptable. They parted
courteously but coolly; and we may be sure that the Prince
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>never forgave Pitt for his uncompromising assertion of the rights
of Parliament.</p>

<p>So dark was the outlook at home and abroad that Pitt was
persuaded, probably by Dundas, Tomline, Rose, and Canning,
to re-consider the whole question with a view to continuance in
office, provided that some suitable position were found for
Addington. The bishop penned some notes of sharp criticism
on the conduct of Addington, affirming that, if he had been
patriotic and sincere, he would have pressed Pitt to remain in
office. The following words are remarkable: "Mr. Pitt, Mr. Dundas
and myself had a long conversation upon this point at Wimbledon;
and I am satisfied that, if Mr. Addington had entered
into the idea cordially, Mr. Pitt's resignation might have been
prevented." He adds that they drew up a tentative scheme of a
Cabinet, Pitt remaining as chief, while Addington was to be a
Secretary of State; but the latter rejected this indignantly.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>
Pitt also finally deemed the plan "utterly improper," and threatened
to hold aloof from those who would not support the new
Administration or croaked about its instability. The action of
Dundas and the bishop was unfortunate; for it gave rise to the
report that Pitt was intriguing with them for a shuffling of
offices in which he would again come out at the top; and, as
usually happens, the meanest version overshadowed the truth.</p>

<p>Fortune willed that the new Ministry, by far the weakest
Ministry of recent times, should win two brilliant successes and
secure a not inglorious peace. So bewildering a change seemed
impossible in the dark days of February&ndash;March 1801, when it
was the bounden duty of every strong man to remain at his
post, and of under-studies to stand aside. The fates and
Addington willed otherwise. Pitt resigned on 14th March,
nineteen days before Nelson triumphed at Copenhagen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pitt had endeavoured to place the nation's finance
on a sound footing. His Budget speech of 18th February has a
ring of confidence and pride. True, the expenses were unprecedentedly
heavy. Great Britain had to provide &pound;12,117,000,
and Ireland &pound;3,785,000, for the army alone. The navy cost
&pound;15,800,000; the Ordnance &pound;1,938,000. The bad seasons or
other causes having lessened the yield of the Income Tax and
the Malt Tax, he proposed further imposts upon sugar, raisins,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>tea, paper, timber, lead, and all exports without exception. He
increased the Excise duty on horses, even those used for agriculture,
on stamp duties, and on the postage of letters. He also
urged that not less than &pound;200,000 (the normal amount) should
be set apart for the reduction of the British National Debt.
Over against these depressing proposals he set the notable
fact that British commerce prospered more than ever, and that
the revenue showed remarkable buoyancy. From these extraordinary
<span class="ins" title="symptons">symptoms</span> he augured that the strength and spirit of
the people were equal to all the demands of the crisis; and he
declared that the attachment of the nation to its revered monarch
and beloved constitution furnished a moving spectacle to
Europe. The House accepted these crushing imposts without
demur.</p>

<p>He found it more difficult to reconcile his followers to the
sway of Addington. As we have seen, Dundas had already expressed
to Pitt his scorn of him and his desire for a Portland
Ministry. Rose also refused to serve under a man whom he
accused (unjustly, as we now know) of worming his way to office;
and the high-spirited Canning declined to give to Pitt any pledge
except that he would not laugh at the new Prime Minister. It
is clear that Canning, like his chief, disliked resignation. As
the gifted young Irishman wrote, it was not at all good fun to
move out of the best house in London (Downing Street) and
hunt about for a little dwelling.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> Ryder and Steele kept their
posts.</p>

<p>Singular to relate, the Mr. Pliable of so many Ministries was
soon to be turned out. Loughborough, on whose back Addington
climbed to power, forthwith received a direct intimation to
withdraw. The Lord Chancellor therefore closed his career, the
King bestowing on him for his services to religion the title Earl
of Rosslyn. To finish with him, we may note that his settlement
near Windsor and his assiduous courting of the royal
favour finally secured an epitaph quite as piquant as any which
George bestowed. On hearing of Rosslyn's sudden death early
in 1805, the King earnestly asked the messenger whether the
news was trustworthy; and, on receiving a reassuring reply, he
said: "Then, he has not left a greater knave behind him in my
dominions." The comment of Thurlow on this gracious remark
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>is equally notable: "Then I presume that His Majesty is quite
sane at present."</p>

<p>One of Pitt's friendships was severed by the crisis. As we
have seen, he deeply resented the part played by Auckland. To
his letter of remonstrance he replied very briefly that, widely as
they differed on the topic at issue, they differed quite as much
as to the question on which side there had been a failure of
friendship, confidence, or attention. The rupture became complete
on 20th March, when Auckland declared in the Lords
that Pitt's resignation was involved in mystery which the eye
could not penetrate. The insinuation wounded Pitt deeply; and
his intercourse with Auckland entirely ceased. Pitt was not
exacting in his social intercourse; but no man of high feeling
can endure secret opposition, followed by a veiled insinuation
that what he has done from high principle resulted from
motives that cannot bear the light. This is an unpardonable sin
that ends friendship.</p>

<hr />

<p>With all his outward composure, Pitt must have felt deep distress
at his failure to complete the Union by the act of grace
which he had in contemplation. The time was ripe, indeed overripe,
for a generous experiment, whereby seven tenths of the
Irish people would have gained religious equality. If the populace
of Dublin hailed with joy the St. Patrick's cross on the new
Union Jack,<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> we may be sure that Irishmen, irrespective of
creed, would have joined heart and soul in the larger national
unity which it typified. It is probable that Pitt, when granting
the franchise to Irish Catholics in 1793, resolved to make the
other concessions at an early date. But the cause of Catholic
Emancipation having been prejudiced by the unwise haste of
Fitzwilliam in 1795, and by raids and revolts soon after, the time
of the Union was the first which he could seize with any chance
of success; and he hoped to vitalize that Union by an act which
would then have been hailed as a boon. Such acts of grace are
all too rare in the frigid annals of British Parliaments. The
Anglo-Saxon race builds its political fabric too exclusively on
material interests; and the whole structure is the uglier and
weaker for this calculating hardness. At the time of the Union
with Scotland, the counsellors of Queen Anne utterly failed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>touch the hearts of the Scots; and it was left to commerce
sluggishly and partially to mingle the two peoples. In contrast
with this dullness, how inspiring are the annals of France in the
early and best days of the Revolution. Then the separatist
Provincial System vanished as a miasma; and amidst the eager
hopes and class renunciations of that golden day the French
people found a unity such as legislators alone can neither make
nor unmake. With the insight of a statesman Pitt now sought
to clinch legislation by sentiment. He desired to vivify the
Union with Ireland by a concession which would come with all
the more graciousness because he had not introduced it into the
legal contract of marriage. But the outcome of it all was, for
himself resignation, for the two peoples the continuance of their
age-long feud.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="title spaced">PITT AND HIS FRIENDS (1794&ndash;1805)</p>

<p class="quote">Nothing could be more playful, and at the same time more instructive,
than Pitt's conversation on a variety of topics while sitting in the library at
Cirencester. You never would have guessed that the man before you was
Prime Minister of the country, and one of the greatest that ever filled that
situation. His style and manner were quite those of an accomplished idler.&mdash;"Malmesbury
Diaries," iv, 34.</p>


<p>The conflict of parties and interests is apt to thin the circle
of a statesman's friends; and in that age of relentless strife
the denuding forces worked havoc. Only he who possesses truly
lovable qualities can pass through such a time with comparatively
little loss; and such was the lot of Pitt. True, his circle was
somewhat diminished. The opposition of Bankes had been at
times so sharp as to lessen their intimacy; and the reputation of
Steele had suffered seriously from financial irregularities.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> Pitt's
affection for Dundas and Grenville had also cooled; but on
the whole his friendships stood the test of time better, perhaps,
than those of any statesman of the eighteenth century. Certainly
in this respect he compares favourably with his awe-inspiring
father. Not that Pitt possessed the charm of affability.
On most persons his austere self-concentration produced a repellent
effect; and it must be confessed that the Grenville strain in
his nature dowered him with a fund of more than ordinary
English coldness. Such was the opinion not only of the French
<span lang="fr">&eacute;migr&eacute;s</span>, whom he designedly kept at arm's length, but even of
his followers, to whom his aloofness seemed a violation of the
rules of the parliamentary game. But it was not in his nature to
expand except in the heat of debate or in congenial society. In
general his stiffness was insular, his pre-occupation profound.
Lady Hester Stanhope, who saw much of him in the closing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>years, pictures his thin, tall, rather ungainly figure, stalking
through Hyde Park, oblivious of all surroundings, with head
uptilted, "as if his ideas were <span lang="fr">en air</span>, so that you would have
taken him for a poet."<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<p>The comparison is as flighty as Lady Hester's remarks usually
were, though the passage may depict with truth the air that Pitt
assumed when walking with her. No one else accused him of
having affinities to poets. In truth, so angular was his nature,
so restricted his sympathies, that he never came in touch with
literary men, artists, or original thinkers. His life was the poorer
for it. A statesman should know more than a part of human
life; and Pitt never realized the full extent of his powers
because he spent his time almost entirely amongst politicians of
the same school. His mind, though by no means closed against
new ideas, lacked the eager inquisitiveness of that of Napoleon,
who, before the process of imperial fossilization set in, welcomed
discussions with men of all shades of opinion, and encouraged
in them that frankness of utterance which at once widens and
clarifies the views of the disputants. It is true that Pitt's private
conversations are almost unknown. They appear to have ranged
within political grooves, with frequent excursions into the loved
domains of classical and English literature; but he seems
never to have explored the new realms of speculation and
poetry then opened up by Bentham and the Lake Poets. A
letter of the poet Hayley to him will serve to suggest the extent
of his loss in limiting his intercourse to a comparatively small
coterie:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Felpham, near Chichester, <i>Sept. 9</i>[?].<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Pitt</span>,</p>

<p>Why are you slow in doing the little good in your power? Yes:
great as you are, the real good you can do must be little; but that little
I once believed you would ever haste to do with a generous eagerness
and enthusiasm, and therefore I used to contemplate your character
with an enthusiastic affection. That character, high as it was, sunk in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>my estimation from the calamitous delay concerning the promised
pension of Cowper, a delay which allowed that dear and now released
sufferer to sink into utter and useless distraction before the neglected
promise was fulfilled. Will you make me some amends for the affectionate
concern I suffered for the diminution of your glory in that
business by expediting now a pension eagerly but ineffectively solicited
by many <em>great people</em>, as I am told, for a most deserving woman, the
widow of Mr. Green, the consul at Nice?... Deserve and receive
a kind and constant remembrance in the benedictions of a recluse who
has still the ambition to live in your regard by the good which he
would excite you to perform. At all events forgive this very unexpected
intrusion and importunity from the old and long sequestered admirer of
your youth,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">W. Hayley</span>.</p>
</div>


<p>Hayley's letter is a trifle too presumptuous in tone even for
an old friend; but it affords one more proof of Pitt's neglect of
literary men, though it is but fair to remember that in 1793&ndash;4
he was hard pressed by the outbreak of war with France and the
struggle to keep the Allies together. Still, the greatest of statesmen
is he who, in the midst of world politics, neither neglects
old friends, nor forgets the claims of literature and art. In this
connection it is painful to add that he allowed the yearly stipend
of the King's Painter, Sir Joshua Reynolds, to be reduced from
&pound;200 to &pound;50. On Reynolds soliciting the secretaryship to the
Order of the Bath, he was told that it had been promised to an
official of the Treasury. Another request, proffered through his
patron, the Duke of Rutland, also proved fruitless, and he had
reason to write with some bitterness&mdash;"Mr. Pitt, I fear, has not
much attention to the arts."<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> His neglect of literature and the
arts was the more unfortunate because George&nbsp;III and his sons
did not raise the tone of the Court in this respect, witness the
remark of the King to Gibbon at a State function. "Well,
Mr. Gibbon, it's always scribble, scribble, I suppose."<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

<p>Apart from these obvious limitations in Pitt's nature, there
was a wealth of noble qualities, which ensured life-long devotion
from those who penetrated the protective crust and came to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>know, not the statesman, but the man. In him the qualities that
command respect and excite affection were happily balanced.
To a manly courage which never quailed in the hour of disaster,
and a good sense that provided sage counsels alike in private
and public affairs, he added the tenderer gifts. His affection once
given was not lightly withdrawn. He looked always on the best
side of men, and to that noble failing, if failing it be, most of his
blunders may be ascribed. Even when his confidence was abused,
he was loth to take revenge, so that Canning expressed regret
at his reluctance to punish those who betrayed him.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> Such a
man will often make mistakes, but he will also inspire the devotion
that serves to repair them. Moreover, even his opponents
were forced to admit the conscientiousness of his conduct. On
this topic the testimony of his friend Wilberforce is of value;
for they had differed sharply as to the rupture with France in
1793; and, somewhat later, Wilberforce lamented the relaxation
of Pitt's efforts against the Slave Trade. Yet their differences
did not end their friendship; on 30th November 1797 the philanthropist
wrote as follows to Sir Richard Aclom on the subject
of the reformation of morals:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>... There is one point only on which I will now declare we perfectly
coincide, I mean, that of a general moral reform being the only
real restorative of the health of our body politic. But I hesitate not to
say that, tho' the Government is in its system and principle too much
(indeed ever so little is, as I think, too much) tainted with corruption,
yet it is more sound than the people at large. You appear to feel the
disposition of the public to yield an implicit assent to Ministers without
stopping to investigate the causes of that disposition (which are chiefly
to be found in the violence of the Opposition and the established predominance
of party). I will frankly avow no man has lamented this more
than myself; I may indeed say more than this. I have endeavoured
both in public and in private to fight against it. But selfishness has
diffused itself thro' the whole mass of our people, and <span lang="la">hinc illae lacrymae</span>.
You mistakenly conceive, as do many others, that I am biassed by
personal affection for Mr. Pitt. When we meet, I will rectify your error
on that head....<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>
</div>


<p>Again, on 20th February 1798, Wilberforce wrote to William
Smith, an active Abolitionist and now prominent in the Opposition,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
deploring the dilatoriness of Pitt, but maintaining that
his patriotism was purer and more disinterested than that of
anyone not under the direct influence of Christian principles.
He adds these words:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>I speak not this from the partiality of personal affection. In fact for
several years past there has been so little of the <span lang="la">eadem velle et eadem
nolle</span> that our friendship has starved for want of nutriment. I really love
him for his public qualities and his private ones, though there too he
is much misunderstood. But how can I expect that he should love me
much, who have been so long rendering myself in various ways vexatious
to him, and, above all, when, poor fellow, he never schools his mind by
a cessation from political ruminations, the most blinding, hardening,
and souring of all others?<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>

<p>These passages explain why the personality of Pitt attracted
all that was purest and most patriotic in the public life of
England. Men might disagree with particular actions, but they
saw in him the saving genius of the State; and this was the
dominant feeling until the year 1801 when events scattered his
following and reduced public life almost to a state of chaos.</p>

<p>His character, then, was strong in the virtues of steadfastness
and loyalty, on which the social gifts can root deeply and bear
perennial fruit. Of these he had rich store. His conversations
possessed singular charm; for his melodious voice, facile fancy,
and retentive memory enabled him to adorn all topics. His
favourite themes were the Greek and Latin Classics. The rooms
at Holwood or Walmer were strewn with volumes of his favourite
authors, on whom he delighted to converse at length. Grenville
declared to Wellesley that Pitt was the best classical scholar he
had ever met. Yet, with the delicate tact which bade him enliven,
not dominate, the social circle, he refrained from obtruding
those subjects on occasions when they would be neither known
nor appreciated. Equally good was his knowledge of English
literature; so that in the company of kindred spirits, the flow of
wit and learning, imagination and experience, must have rivalled
that of the Literary Club over which Dr. Johnson held sway.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, only the merest scraps survive; but the testimony
of Pitt's friends suffices to refute the Whig legend as to
his cold and calculating selfishness, which filled even the hours
of leisure with schemes for making himself necessary to the King
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>and country.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> On the contrary, he was fond of society, throwing
himself so heartily into the conversation that the <span lang="fr">savant</span> was
merged in the wit, the Prime Minister in the genial companion.
His jests were of that Attic flavour which seasons without
stinging; and this was the outcome, not of calculation, but of a
kindly disposition, which delighted to throw off political cares
amidst the tide of mirth which he helped to carry to the full.
He also felt increasingly the charms of country life, and at Holwood
was never more happy than when labouring along with
his gardeners in the effort to enhance the beauty of his grounds.
This strenuous work, together with horse exercise and occasional
bursts with the West Kent or Dover hunt, provided the recreation
which enabled his naturally weak and gout-ridden frame to
withstand the wear and tear of official life up to his forty-seventh
year.</p>

<p>In town he delighted to visit friends in an informal manner,
and was never more pleased than when he could have games
with children. His romp with young Napier and the two Stanhopes
when they succeeded in corking his face, has been already
described; but it appears that even in 1805, when beset by
manifold cares, he often dropped in at Broom House, Parson's
Green, the residence of Sir Evan Nepean, and would "take a
chair in a corner, and, laying aside state and gravity, would
gambol and play with the boys."<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> At times his repartees were
piquant. When his friend and admirer, the Duchess of Gordon,
who had not seen him for some time, met him at the <span lang="fr">lev&eacute;e</span> and
asked whether he talked as much nonsense as of yore, he laughingly
replied: "I do not know whether I talk so much nonsense:
certainly I do not <em>hear</em> so much."<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></p>

<p>Is it surprising that a character so benevolent, and social gifts
of so much charm, should attract men about him? Of those who
came forward to fill the gaps of the circle, only two, Wellesley
and Canning, were men of powers so exceptional as to claim
more than passing notice. Though descended from families
domiciled in Ireland, they differed widely, except in versatility
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>and devotion to Pitt. Wellesley's nature was Saxon in its inner
hardness. Like his younger brother, the future Duke of Wellington,
he rarely displayed signs of emotion; but his temperament,
though cold at the heart, thrilled at the approach of great and
perilous enterprises, amidst which he rivalled his brother in
activity and resourcefulness. Accordingly, his Viceroyalty of
India moved Bonaparte to envy, patriotic Britons to rapturous
applause, and the parsimonious Directors of the Company to
carping criticisms. Those who deny to Pitt the gift of choosing
able and inspiring men, forget that he made Wellesley Governor-General
of India, and supported him in his quarrels with the
India House. As Earl of Mornington, Wellesley had helped
the Irish Administration in various ways, and became closely
acquainted with the Grenvilles. His first letter to Pitt, dated
Dublin, January 1785, expresses thanks for assistance and for
the offer of support in case the annoyances of his situation drove
him to England. Thus, Mornington was first attracted to Pitt
by his loyalty to subordinates; and, later, after his return to
England, respect for the Minister ripened into admiration and
love of the man.</p>

<p>They had much in common. Manly in bearing, persistent of
purpose, and prompt in decision, they were also richly dowered
with social gifts. Like Pitt, Mornington had classical attainments
and literary gifts of no mean order; and his high spirits
and powers of repartee must have brought new energy to the
jaded statesman. Entering Parliament as member for Windsor,
he found his duties far from congenial. On some occasions
nervousness marred the effect of his speeches; and his constituents
involved him in so much expense and worry as to prompt
a request, in the autumn of 1794, for the intervention of Pitt,
seeing that his rival, Isherwood, had "the means of supplying
the rapacity even of the electors of Windsor." On 4th October
he thanked Pitt for relieving him from further obligations to
"the worthy electors of that loyal borough"; but he continued
for a time to sit in Parliament. Meanwhile his fine presence and
lively converse brought him into favour with the Prince of
Wales. On 4th August 1793, writing at Brighthelmstone, he
heartily congratulated Pitt on the surrender of Valenciennes,
which sanguine persons hoped might hasten the end of the war.
But, he added, "I own my most sanguine expectations cannot
reach the notion of our being able to bring down the power of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
France in one campaign to the level to which I think it must be
reduced for our safety and for that of the rest of the world.
H.R.H. the Prince of Wales has been pleased to be most gracious
to me.... I suppose you have heard of his dinner on the capture
of Valenciennes. We sat from five till half-past ten, and
many were very drunk, particularly H.R.H. He really did the
honours most admirably...." In the next letter, of the early part
of August 1796, Mornington sends a quatrain of Latin Elegiacs
which he had composed at Dundas's house, on the exploits of
Wurmser in relieving Mantua, of Davidovitch at Roveredo, and
Quosdanovitch at Brescia (not Verona), which seemed to presage
the ruin of Bonaparte.</p>


<p class="poem" lang="la" style="font-style: normal">
Mantua Vurmisero gaudet, Rovereda Davido,<br />
<span class="i2" style="font-style: normal">Et Verona tibi, Quosdanovice, patet.<br /></span>

<span class="i2" style="font-style: normal">Heu! Bona pars in rem cogar abire malam.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor" style="font-style: normal">[617]</a></span>
</p>


<p>For some time Mornington had felt the charm of Indian history;
and the blend of energy with romance in his being may have
prompted Pitt's selection of him as Viceroy in 1797. After a
most tedious voyage he reached the Hooghly in time to foil the
blow which Tippoo Sahib, Bonaparte's prospective ally, aimed
at Madras. In his letter to Pitt, written there on 20th April
1799, he expressed a hope of the capture of Seringapatam, and
continues thus: "I assure you that my nerves are much strengthened
by all the exertions which I have been obliged to make,
and in this land of indolence I pass for rather an active, stout,
hardy fellow and can now fast till four o'clock (save only a bit
of biscuit and a glass of port). I am happy to hear that you are
better than you have ever been in your life. There is no comfort
in mine but the distant hope of seeing you all again safe,
well, and quizzing in England. I have only one request to make
to you if you do not mean to abridge either my doleful days or
the period of my Government&mdash;do not suffer that <i>cantancerous</i>
[<span lang="la">sic</span>] fellow, Sir J[ames] Craig, to be made commander-in-chief
in Bengal. Send me a sober discreet decent man, but do not
allow the etiquette of throwing inkstands to be revived at the
Council Board."<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span></p>
<p>On 12th May, after announcing to Pitt the capture of Seringapatam,
Mornington adds: "If Buonaparte should now chuse
to visit Malabar, I think he will find supper prepared for him
before he has reached Calcutta." Reviewing the events of his
Viceroyalty he writes on 8th August: "I suppose you will
either hang me or magnificently honour me for my deeds (mine
they are, be they good or bad). In either case I shall be gratified;
for an English gallows is better than an Indian throne; but
these words must be buried in your own breast; for here I pretend
to be very happy and humble; although I am as proud as
the D. and as wretched as his dam. I think you will enjoy 'Le
Cito&iuml;en Tipou' and 'Cito&iuml;en Sultan' in the papers found at
Seringapatam. I admire your conduct with respect to the
Union [with Ireland]. I hope you will persevere, but I <em>trust</em> you
will not <em>trust</em> Ireland to my old friend Hobart. He used to be
a good humoured fellow; but from what I have heard of his
reign here, he is utterly unfit to govern anywhere."<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></p>

<p>Pitt did not receive this letter by 6th November, when he
informed Wellesley that the King, as a mark of high approbation,
conferred on him the title the Marquis Wellesley, suitable
arrangements being also in contemplation for his family. An
Irish marquisate was far from the magnificent reward which the
Viceroy desired; and on 28th April 1800 he expressed his
anguish of mind at receiving only an Irish and pinchbeck
reward for exploits neither Irish nor pinchbeck. Nevertheless,
while requesting a speedy recall so that he might hide his
chagrin in retirement, he uttered no vindictive word against
Pitt. Despite its morbid expressions, the letter is that of a
friend to a friend. On 27th September Pitt wrote in reply one
of the longest of his private letters. With equal tact and frankness
he reviewed the whole question, proving that Wellesley's
services were not undervalued, that the bestowal of an English
marquisate would have been an advance of four steps in the
peerage for what was after all a short Viceroyalty; and that the
present honour equalled that conferred on Cornwallis at the end
of his term. The question was whether Wellesley should receive
an English earldom or an Irish marquisate; and the latter was
deemed preferable. Further, if the notion prevailed at Calcutta
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>that Wellesley had been slighted, it might be due to a suspicion
that he himself harboured it. Pitt then begged Wellesley to
regard this frankness as the best proof of real friendship.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p>Wellesley showed his good sense by acquiescing, and their
letters though rare, became thoroughly cordial. Writing at
Patna on 6th October 1801, he gently reproached Pitt for his
long silence, especially for not explaining the reason of his
resignation; he also expressed the hope that he approved his
remaining at Calcutta until a successor was appointed. He added
that his state progress up the Ganges to Patna had been
favoured by an easterly gale of unusual strength which the
natives ascribed either to his happy star or to an Order in
Council. As for his health, it was better than in "the reeking
House of Commons." Again at the beginning of 1804 he expressed
regret that Pitt had neither written nor vouchsafed any
sign of approbation at recent events, including the victory of
Assaye, which assured British ascendancy in the East.</p>

<p>At last, on 30th August 1804, three months after resuming
office, Pitt apologized for his neglect on the ground of excess of
work in preparing to meet a French invasion, in which he had
so far succeeded as to hope that the attempt might be made.
At that time he expected Wellesley to come home in order to
escape the petty cabals of the Company's Directors; but he left
the decision entirely to him. Pitt's next letter, at Christmastide,
breathes a profound hope for Wellesley's speedy arrival as a
means of lightening the then heavy burden of political life.
Wellesley, however, on 25th March 1805, announced his chivalrous
resolve to remain in India another season owing to financial
troubles and disputes with the Company. To Dundas, in May
1805, he wrote: "I imagined myself to be one of the best friends
of the Company, but I hear that I am a traitor, and a conspirator,
and an interloper. Time discovers truth, and I must
leave the Honourable Courts' opinions to that test."<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> In August,
after transferring his duties to Cornwallis, he set sail for England,
and landed in time to have a few last words with Pitt. The
interview must have been deeply affecting. At its conclusion
Pitt fainted away. Of all the estimates of Pitt none breathes
deeper devotion than that of Wellesley. Was it not because he
at last saw the pettiness of his own pride and petulance when contrasted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
with the self-abnegation of him who was truly the Great
Commoner? And did not even his meteoric career in the East
pale before the full-orbed splendour of the quarter of a century
of achievement which made up the public life of Pitt?</p>

<p>The other enthusiastic friend was typically Irish in temperament.
Celtic in vivacity and charm, feminine in sensitiveness,
Canning was dowered with virile persistence and pugnacity. In
histrionic and versifying power he rivalled his countryman,
Sheridan, who never forgave him for deserting the Whigs and
going over to Pitt. The loss was indeed serious; for the young
orator was far more than a <span lang="fr">frondeur</span>. As editor of the "Anti-Jacobin,"
conjointly with Hookham Frere, he covered with ridicule
the detractors of their country, and helped on the revival of
national spirit which began in 1798. But he also possessed great
administrative talents, displaying as Under-Secretary for Foreign
Affairs an insight into character in which his chief, Grenville,
was signally lacking. Canning's letters to Pitt on the negotiation
at Lille in 1797 show signs of those inductive powers which
appear at their zenith in his brilliantly correct inference ten
years later that the Danish fleet must be snatched from the
clutch of Napoleon.</p>

<p>The statuesque calm of Pitt's personality charmed and overawed
this impressionable Irishman from the time of their first
interview in the summer of 1792. Always versatile and sometimes
shifty, he seems instinctively to have felt in him the
needed counterpart. As the Czar Alexander leaned on the rock-like
Stein in the crisis of 1812, so Canning gained strength and
confidence from reliance on Pitt. He on his side took a keen
interest in his disciple, discerning in him the propagator of the
Pitt doctrine and tradition. At times the fostering care became
fatherly. A case in point was Canning's marriage with a wealthy
Scottish heiress (July 1800). Pitt regarded this event as essential
to his success as the future leader of the party. Indeed, so
absorbed was he in his own thoughts during the ride to the
church as not to notice a pert remark of Canning's friend, Hookham
Frere. The clergyman, Frere, and he were in a coach
driving along Swallow Street towards Brook Street when a
carter who saw them called out: "What! Billy Pitt! and with a
parson too!" Thereupon Frere burst out with the daring jest,
"He thinks you are going to Tyburn to be hanged privately!"
But Pitt was too pre-occupied to notice the gibe. Again, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
the ceremony, in the vestry Pitt was so nervous as to be unable
to sign as a witness, and Canning had to whisper to Frere to
sign without waiting for him.<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> They ascribed his strange inaction
to extreme regard for Canning. But surely another explanation
is more natural. How could a man of keenly affectionate nature
share in that ceremony without feeling deeply his own lonely
lot? Three and a half years ago poverty and debt had stepped
in to part him and Eleanor Eden. Was it not the wraith of his
buried love which now hovered before him, blotting out the
sight of the carter, deafening his ears to the jest, and palsying
his hand?</p>

<hr />

<p>Pitt's resignation of office sorely tried his friends; for, without
informing them of the inmost reasons that prompted that step,
he pressed them to remain in office under his successor, Addington.
As we have seen, some of them refused. Of those not holding
Cabinet appointments, Rose and Long, joint Secretaries of the
Treasury, Lord Granville Leveson-Gower, a Lord of the Treasury,
and Canning, joint Paymaster of the Forces, decided to resign.
Pitt's silence and his urgent requests to his friends to remain in
office were of course open to misconstruction; and several of his
supporters echoed the malicious assertion of Frere, that his aim
was for Addington to take office as a <span lang="la">locum tenens</span>, and sign a
discreditable peace, whereupon he (Pitt) would come back to
power and find his former supporters in their old places.
Malmesbury gave colour to the story by stating that Addington
described himself as <span lang="la">locum tenens</span>, a remark utterly inconsistent
with all that is known of his complacent pride. Nevertheless the
slander gained general currency, and, even now, despite convincing
refutation, dies hard. That Canning and others resented
Pitt's silence and his pressure to remain in office is undeniable;
but, while saying nothing as to the cause of his own conduct, he
explained clearly to Canning that, as a friend, he was gratified
by his conduct in resigning, however much he deplored his
action on public grounds. Of course the <span lang="la">tu quoque</span> retort was
inevitable; but Canning's curiosity was not gratified.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></p>

<p>For a time he talked of breaking with Pitt, and sent him a
copy of a letter to Frere couched in those terms. Pitt replied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>calmly on 26th April 1801 that on reviewing his conduct he
found it neither unkind nor unfair. While lamenting that Canning
should thus have misunderstood his conduct, he expressed
a resolve to forget the incident and a hope that their friendship
might endure. Serenity such as this is the best cure to Celtic
susceptibility. But other grievances were discovered, and on
12th July Canning dashed off to Frere a furious missive full
of dashes and underlinings, charging Pitt with showing to him
"confidence just enough to mislead and not enough to guide";
on which promising theme he fired off clause upon clause of an
incoherent sentence which fills thirty-five lines of print and then
expires in a dash. What it was all about is far from clear, except
that Canning believed Pitt to have done "scrupulously
and magnanimously <em>right</em> by everybody but <em>me</em>."<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> Before long
the sensitive youth was moving heaven and earth to bring back
Pitt to power. But, even in December 1803, when his whole
soul was bound up in him, he reproached him with lover-like
vehemence for having inspired a derogatory article in the
"Accurate Observer." Apparently the wounded friend had no
proof whatever that Pitt had sped or barbed the shaft.</p>

<p>Among those who won Pitt's confidence in his closing years
was Spencer Perceval, an able young barrister, who entered
Parliament in 1796 as member for Northampton, and showed
considerable skill in finance and debating powers of no mean
order. "He spoke (says Sinclair) without the disagreeable cant
of the Bar, was never tedious, was peculiarly distinct in matters
of business, and explained his financial measures with clearness
and ability. His style was singularly acute, bold, sarcastic, and
personal." The same authority avers that Pitt, on being asked&mdash;"If
we lose you, where could we find a successor?"&mdash;answered
at once, "Perceval." The reply is remarkable; for Perceval,
besides opposing Catholic Emancipation, displayed little tact in
dealing with men and a strangely narrow outlook. Probably it
was his power of hard work, his grasp of finance, and his resolute
disposition which led Pitt to prefer him to Canning, who in
other respects was far better qualified to act as leader.</p>

<p>I must here notice charges which have been brought against
Pitt, that his creations of peers, or promotions in the peerage,
which by the year 1801 exceeded 140, were fraught with evil to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>the Upper House, lowering the intellectual level of its debates,
and impairing the balance of parties, with results damaging to
the constitution.<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> It has even been suggested that the friction
between the two Houses in the years 1830&ndash;1911 resulted in no
small degree from the reckless conduct of Pitt in this respect.
Vague and sweeping assertions like these can neither be substantiated
nor refuted. But the only definite part of them,
namely, that Pitt's creations degraded the House of Lords, is
obviously overstrained. At no period was the tone of its debates
higher than in that of Pitt's supremacy, witness those on Warren
Hastings, the disputes with Spain and Russia, and the Great
War. They have not the brilliance of those of the Commons in
the days of Burke, Fox, Pitt and Sheridan; but they often excel
them in statesmanlike qualities; and a perusal of them reveals
the fact that the ablest of the Lords were, not those of the old
governing families, which at that period showed signs of decadence,
but those for whose creation Pitt was mainly responsible.
Malmesbury, Buckingham, Grenville, Auckland, Carrington,
Minto, and at a later period, Sidmouth and Castlereagh, excelled
in ability and weight the representatives of the older nobility.
Far from degrading and weakening the peerage, Pitt strengthened
it by an infusion of new blood which was sorely needed at that
time of strain and stress. Further, it must be remembered that
Burke's Economy Bill had abolished many of the sinecures
which were considered due for steady support in Parliament; and,
while at Bath in the year 1797, he admitted that his reform was
accountable for the large increase of peerages, thenceforth the
chief hope of the faithful.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> Pitt's correspondence also shows that
he frequently repulsed the insistent claims of his supporters for
titles, a theme on which piquant letters might be adduced.</p>

<p>Surely, too, it is unjust to say that Pitt entirely altered the
political complexion of the Upper House. During the greater
part of his career the so-called political differences were based
mainly on personal considerations; and throughout the struggle
against France, Whigs and Tories, with the exception of a small
coterie, were merged in the national party which recognized in
Pitt the saviour of British institutions. The charge that he was
largely responsible for the friction between the two Houses after
1830 needs little notice; for that friction was clearly due to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>progress of democratic principles and the growth of an enormous
industrial community in these islands. Both of those developments
told strongly against the parity of political influence of
the two Houses of Parliament. Amidst the torpor of the previous
age the prerogatives of the Peers had gone unchallenged.
After the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution a
challenge was certain to come; and in this, as in many other
respects, the conduct of Pitt was such as to strengthen our institutions.
By adding to the House of Lords a considerable
number of commoners he enabled it to withstand the storms of
the Revolutionary age and the inevitable conflicts of the future.</p>

<hr />

<p>To revert to the year 1801, there occurred early in the autumn
an event of high import. The struggle of eight years between
Great Britain and France ended in stalemate. The collapse
of the Armed Neutrality League together with the capture of
Malta and the surrender of the French garrisons in Egypt left
the Union Jack triumphant at sea and the tricolour on the Continent.
Each State had need of rest to restore its finances and
consolidate its conquests. Therefore, though Bonaparte had at
the end of March 1801 sharply repelled the pacific overtures of
the Addington Cabinet, yet negotiations were resumed at the
close of summer, a fact which proves that the First Consul was
influenced, not by spite to Pitt and goodwill to his successor,
but by the constricting grip of the Sea Power. Hawkesbury,
Grenville's successor at the Foreign Office, asserted that shortly
before the end of the negotiation Pitt sat up with him through
part of a night discussing finance, and finally advising the cessation
of hostilities.</p>

<p>Not that Pitt directed the negotiations; for both Addington
and Hawkesbury were proud and sensitive men, and Pitt
at some points criticized the conditions of the Preliminaries
of London (1st October 1801). They were as follows: Great
Britain agreed to restore to France, Spain, and the Batavian, or
Dutch, Republic all their possessions recently conquered by her,
with the exception of Trinidad and Ceylon, ceded to her by
Spain and the Dutch respectively. She also retired from Elba
and restored Malta to the Knights of St. John, under conditions
to be further specified. The French restored Egypt to the
Sultan, and evacuated Naples and the Papal States. Portugal
was also saved from danger of partition. Nothing was said respecting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
the resumption of trade between England and France;
and no assurance was forthcoming as to the independence of the
Republics bordering on France. By his recent compact with
Austria the First Consul agreed to respect their independence;
but England had no definite ground for complaint if it were
violated.</p>

<p>While the London rabble shouted itself hoarse with joy at the
advent of peace, Grenville, Windham, and Canning saw disgrace
and disaster ahead. Pitt thought otherwise. At the small house
in Park Place which he had leased for his visits to London, he
wrote to Long on 1st October, describing the terms as not all
that could be wished but "highly creditable, and on the whole
very advantageous." Finding that Grenville considered them
disastrous, he on the 5th expressed concern at their disagreement.
Though regretting the surrender of the Cape, and the
uncertainty of the fate of Malta, he considered the acquisition
of Ceylon and Trinidad most beneficial; and he hailed with
satisfaction a peace which saved Turkey and Portugal from
spoliation. He therefore suggested an interview for the sake
of reconciling their differences. To this Grenville somewhat
coolly assented, remarking that the differences were fundamental
and could not be concealed, and that his confidence in the Addington
Cabinet was irretrievably destroyed by a treaty which
ceded to France Martinique, Malta, Minorca, the Cape, Cochin
China, and all the Dutch settlements. Clearly, then, Grenville
looked on the Dutch Republic and Spain as dominated by
Bonaparte, who would seize Minorca, Malta, and the Cape whenever
it suited him. He also wrote to the King expressing regret
that he could no longer support Addington, whose conduct towards
France and Russia was "marked throughout by a tone of
unnecessary and degrading concession."<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, the two cousins began sharply to differ. On 3rd
November, during the debates on the Peace, Pitt rose to rebut the
censures of Thomas Grenville on a policy which implied the surrender
of the Mediterranean to France. He deprecated these sweeping
criticisms; for he had ever been ready to frame a treaty which,
though falling short of our just pretensions, was not inconsistent
with honour and security. The present terms did not fulfil all his
wishes; but the difference between them and the best possible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>terms was not worth the continuance of war. If both Trinidad
and Malta could not be retained, he commended Ministers for
choosing Trinidad; for the sight of the Union Jack at Malta would
have hurt the pride of France. With regard to the Cape of Good
Hope he deemed it a far more important possession than
Hawkesbury had represented, though inferior to Ceylon. He
deplored our failure to restore the House of Savoy to its capital,
Turin; but the chief object of the war, the security of Great
Britain, had been attained. True, the restoration of the French
monarchy would have furnished a better safeguard for peace;
but we had never insisted on it as essential, though it might have
been assured if the Allies had fulfilled their duties. As to the
future, if the First Consul aimed at founding a military despotism,
he probably would not select England as the first object of his
attack; and we had every prospect of enjoying a long peace.
Remembering, perhaps, that he made the same prophecy early
in 1792, he uttered this warning: "I am inclined to hope everything
that is good; but I am bound to act as if I feared otherwise."
In none of his speeches did Pitt display less foresight.
The preference of Trinidad to Malta and of Ceylon to the Cape
is curious enough; but the prophecy as to a long period of
peace and the probable immunity of England from Bonaparte's
attack argues singular blindness to the colonial trend of French
policy since the year 1798. Despite acrid comments by Fox and
Windham, the speech carried the day and firmly established
Addington in power.</p>

<p>The sequel is well known. In the interval of six months,
during which the aged and gouty Cornwallis sought to reduce
the Preliminaries of London to the Treaty of Amiens (27th
March 1802), Bonaparte remodelled the Batavian, Ligurian, and
Cisalpine Republics in a way wholly at variance with the Treaty
of Lun&eacute;ville. Against these breaches of faith the Addington
Cabinet made no protest; and the treaty in its final form provided
a complex and unsatisfactory compromise on the Maltese
question.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> Canning and Windham strove to elicit from Pitt a
public expression of his disapproval of the treaty; but their
efforts were in vain. On 20th April 1802 Canning, while at his
country seat, South Hill, Bracknell (Berks), wrote thus to
Windham:<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>... Do not suppose that this is because I have the slightest doubt
as to the impression which may be made by pointing out the gross
faults and omissions, the weakness, and baseness, and shuffling, and
stupidity, that mark this Treaty even beyond the Preliminaries that led
to it. But I think people do not want to be convinced of this; that
they will not take it kindly, but rather otherwise, to have it forced upon
their observation; that, if parted to a division, they will vote for the
Treaty with all its imperfections upon its head.... Now as to Pitt
himself. He cannot and does not think of this as he did of the Preliminary
Treaty. But debate it; and he will, he must, debate as warmly
for it. He can take no distinction without seeming to abandon Addington;
and that he will not do. He cannot object to any part of the
Peace in public, without weakening the grounds upon which he contends
peace upon the whole to be preferable to war, and <em>that</em> he will not do.
... Leave it possible for Pitt to say six or eight months hence that
the Preliminaries promised well, but that the Treaty did not come up
to them. I do not promise you that he ever will say this. But I am
fairly persuaded that, if you force from him a public approbation of the
Treaty, you defer for at least as many months as have passed since the
debates of October, the chance of his coming to see things almost as
you and I see them....</p>

<p>Since I wrote to you, I have seen Lord Grenville, and I think the
plan of action, which he tells me had been concerted between you and
him, so perfect, that I retract everything in what I wrote to you (if
anything there were) which could be construed as making against it.
To debate "about it and about it," as much as you will, to move for
papers, to move for taking the Treaty into consideration&mdash;all this may
be done with great and good effect, but a condemnation of the Treaty,
such as would force P[itt] into a defence of it, and identify him with
the makers of it, is what of all things is to be avoided. I hope you
think so.&mdash;Whether P[itt] <em>will</em> save us I do not know. But surely he is
the only man that <em>can</em>.</p>
</div>


<p>All was in vain. Pitt, having promised to support Addington,
deemed himself in honour bound to fulfil that pledge. But, as
the events of the year 1802 showed more and more the imbecility
of the Addington Cabinet, torturing doubts preyed upon
his mind. His friends, especially Canning, now began to discern
the pathos of his position, but sought to draw him from his
seclusion at Walmer. An opportunity occurred in the month of
May. Pitt's birthday was on the 28th. Would not all who foresaw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
ruin for England in the supremacy of "the Doctor" welcome
a demonstration on behalf of his predecessor? For more than a
year Pitt's friends had been puzzled and abashed by his unexplained
retirement, witness the uncharitable surmise of the
usually benevolent Dr. Burgh&mdash;"Can I see Addington climb
upon the stooping neck of Mr. Pitt, and not believe that it is
done in hostility or in a masked confederacy? If the former,
how am I to estimate the man who comes in? If the latter, what
judgement can I form of the man who goes out?"<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> Slander also
was busy in the guise of that gadfly, Nicholls, who proposed to
thank the King for dismissing him. By way of retort Pitt's
friends triumphantly carried a motion of thanks to Pitt for his
great services, against a carping minority of fifty-two; but
members were heard to mutter their preference for Addington
over all "the d&mdash;d men of genius."</p>

<p>Was it not time to arouse the country from sloth? The
England of 1802 seemed to Wordsworth</p>


<p class="poem">
a fen of stagnant waters.
</p>


<p>While he invoked the memory of Milton, Canning resolved to
appeal to Pitt. In a day or two he threw off a poem which,
though slighted by him, gained a wider vogue than any of his
effusions, "The Pilot that weathered the Storm." The last and
best stanza is as follows:</p>


<p class="poem">
And O! if again the rude whirlwind should rise,<br />
<span class="i2">The dawning of peace should fresh darkness deform,<br /></span>
The regrets of the good and the fears of the wise<br />
<span class="i2">Shall turn to the pilot that weathered the storm.<br /></span>
</p>


<p>The song was enthusiastically received by the company assembled
at the Merchant Taylors' Hall; and the reference to the
recall of Pitt roused the company to a high pitch of excitement.
The song, as a whole, is laboured and strained. The only stanza
which happily weds phrase and thought is the last. The others
form a lumbering prelude to this almost Sibylline cadence.</p>

<p>Despite these efforts to sow discord between Pitt and Addington,
they remained on excellent terms;<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> and the support given
by the former to the Peace of Amiens ensured to the Minister an
overwhelming victory at the polls in the General Election of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>summer of 1802. Pitt was of course returned by the University
of Cambridge, "with every mark of zeal and cordiality"&mdash;so he
wrote to Rose on 10th July. The rest of the summer he passed
either near London or at Walmer. It is unfortunate that he did
not visit France, as Fox, Romilly, and many others now did.
Probably his sharp rebuff to Bonaparte's overture at the end of
1799, and his subsequent diatribes against him precluded such
a step. But he also needed rest and quiet. On 8th June
he wrote to Windham: "The sea air and the contrast of the
scene to that which I left behind me in London have, as usual,
done me a great deal of good."<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> He set to work to improve the
grounds adjoining the castle, and invited Addington, who was
then spending some weeks at Eastbourne, to come over and see
the changes. Further, he leased a large farm near Walmer, and
expressed a hope that he might spend the rest of the year in
farming. The splendour of that summer and the bounteous
crops of corn evidently captivated Pitt. The supreme need
of England was more corn. A man who could not serve her at
Westminster could serve her by high farming. This was Pitt's
forecast, unless "the <span lang="la">pacificator</span> of Europe takes it into his head
to send an army from the opposite coast to revenge himself for
some newspaper paragraph."<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>

<p>At this time, too, he finally succeeded in disposing of Holwood.
The sale was inevitable; for Pitt's finance had long been a
source of deep anxiety. So far back as 18th October 1800
Rose informed the Bishop of Lincoln that bailiffs threatened
the seizure of Pitt's furniture in Downing Street for debts of &pound;600
and &pound;400. Then, referring to Pitt's ill health, he wrote: "I conceived
till this morning [it] was owing to the state of public
matters; but I am now strongly inclined to think he is agitated
by the state of his own affairs. Bullock came to me this morning
and forced upon me such a history of debts and distresses
as actually sickened me.... Something must be done before
Pitt returns to town. His expenses in the last years were nearly
&pound;26,000. I am quite certain Holwood must be parted with."<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a></p>

<p>Pitt's private finance is involved in mystery. His official
stipend was &pound;6,000 a year; and as Lord Warden of the Cinque
Ports he drew &pound;3,000 more. Yet he was now insolvent. Among
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>his papers systematic accounts are extant only for the latter
half of the years 1794 and 1799. Even these are not complete,
especially for the household at Walmer Castle. Those
for the house in Downing Street are the fullest; but, for the last
six months of 1799, they amount to &pound;3,789 at Downing Street,
and &pound;2,382 at Holwood, the latter sum including a charge of
&pound;1,163 for farm expenses which cannot much have exceeded the
income.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> The Walmer accounts vary according to the duration
of Pitt's residence. Those for the summer and autumn of 1794
amount only to &pound;458. Evidently, then, Pitt benefited by the
King's gift of the Wardenship of the Cinque Ports. But he gave
&pound;1,000 in 1793 to start the Dover Volunteer corps and doubtless
other sums towards the Fencibles of the other Cinque Ports.</p>

<p>At all times the servants at Downing Street and the farm at
Holwood were a heavy drain. The amount of the servants' private
bills charged to Pitt at Downing Street is disgraceful. Pitt kept
a good table and a good cellar, as the customs of the age required;
but neither these expenses nor his heavy outlay on his
tailor would have brought about a crisis, had not his town servants
and tradesmen plundered him. Morse, the tailor, charged at
the rate of &pound;130 to &pound;140 a quarter for Pitt's clothes. Now Pitt
was neat and punctilious in his attire, but he was no dandy. As
for the farm at Holwood, accounts for straw and manure were
charged twice over, as some friendly accountant pointed out.
Probably, too, his experiments in landscape-gardening were as
costly as they had been to Chatham; for lavishness was in the
nature both of father and son. Pitt once confessed to his niece,
Hester Stanhope, that he never saw a house and grounds without
at once planning improvements. In this phrase as in the
suggestive item on farm expenses we can see why the sale of
Holwood was necessary; but for various reasons it did not take
place until the autumn of 1802.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his friends bestirred themselves to prevent the
scandal of an execution. They succeeded in staving off a crisis
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>until schemes of relief were concerted, but here again there was
much difficulty; for, on hearing of the proposed private subscription
on his behalf, he declared that he would rather return
to practice at the Bar than submit to such a humiliation. Fox
might allow friends to pay his gambling debts; but the pride of
Pitt scorned to accept help on behalf of liabilities even if due to
pre-occupation in public affairs. Rose deemed a sum of &pound;25,000
necessary to his peace and quietness, seeing that the total
liabilities were &pound;45,064. The letters which passed between Camden,
the Bishop of Lincoln, and Rose, evince deep affection for
the shy, proud man. The following is a <span lang="fr">pr&eacute;cis</span> of a letter of Rose
to Tomline which is among the Pretyman MSS.:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Christchurch, <i>July 21, 1801</i>.</p>

<p>I am in great perplexity about Pitt's affairs. Joe Smith has been
strangely misled respecting them.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> The unforeseen demands have been
very large. If Holwood fetches a good price, the sum of &pound;24,000 will
set the matter at rest. Pitt's diamonds have been sold for &pound;680 to pay
pressing claims. The unpaid bills now amount to &pound;9,618. Old debts
come to &pound;9,600 more. Mr. Soane and Mr. Coutts might be asked to
wait, as neither would suffer from it. The debt due to Banker (&pound;5,800)
cannot surely be a separate one of Pitt's; for I think he could give no
security on it. Probably it is a debt contracted jointly with Lord Chatham,
the whole of which Pitt may have to pay. Of the last sum which
in his own deep distress he borrowed on the security of Holwood, he
gave (I know) &pound;1,000 to Lord Chatham. These are trifling considerations
compared with that of getting him to accept the means of relief.
They are as follows: (1) a vote from Parliament; (2) a free gift from
the King; (3) a private subscription; (4) an additional office for life.
The first and second of these Pitt has peremptorily declined. The third
he refused in 1787 when the London merchants offered &pound;100,000.
The fourth course would not be wholly creditable, but Pitt thinks it
the least objectionable. He dislikes the second and third alternatives
because the second (as he thinks) would give the King a hold over him
and the third would entitle the subscribers to his favour. The notion of
an execution by bailiffs in his house is too painful to contemplate. I
consider the first or second alternatives the best.</p>
</div>


<p>The reference here to a gift, or loan, from Pitt to his brother
prompts the inquiry whether similar acts of benevolence may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>not explain his difficulties. We find the second Earl of Chatham
in August 1797 acknowledging a loan of &pound;1,000 from Pitt. The
bishop, replying to Rose on 24th July 1801, states that the
debt of &pound;5,800 was to the best of his knowledge a sum advanced
through Thomas Coutts, the banker, to Lady Chatham upon the
Burton Pynsent estate. He adds that she ought to pay interest
to Pitt upon it, but did not. It seems that Pitt advanced &pound;11,750
in all on behalf of the Burton Pynsent estate. Here, then, was
a grievous family burden. Probably the debt was left by his
father, and may have been increased by his mother. So far back
as November 1793 he wrote to her stating his desire to help
her at any time of need; and in August of the following year,
when she believed her end to be near, she begged her sons to
pay her "just debts," which were due, not to vain expenses, but
to outlays upon the farm which she at the time believed to
be for the best.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> The eldest son could not help her, for he required
succour from Pitt. If, then, the farming experiments at
Burton Pynsent failed, the loss fell upon Pitt. We may infer,
then, that his debts were occasioned partly by rapacious servants
and tradesmen in London, partly by farming and gardening at
Holwood, but also by the needs of his mother and brother. The
fact that Chatham paid not a shilling towards the discharge of
Pitt's liabilities proves that he was in low water; and as no
one, not even Tomline, knew of the source of Pitt's embarrassments,
they must have been of a peculiarly delicate character.</p>

<p>Tomline's decision, that Pitt could never accept a sinecure
from Addington, is indisputable. The words in which Pitt declared
that he could not accept the sum of &pound;30,000 graciously
offered by the King breathe more independence than those in
which he first expressed his gratitude for the offer. There remained,
then, the plan of a private subscription. The Bishop of
Lincoln mentioned it to him with admirable delicacy on 6th
August 1801, and gained his consent. The following were the
subscribers: Lords Bathurst, Camden, and Carrington, together
with Tomline, Rose, and Steele, &pound;1,000 each. From Scotland
came &pound;4,000, probably in equal parts from the Dukes of Buccleugh
and Gordon, Dundas, and the Chief Baron. Wilberforce,
Long, and Joseph Smith each gave &pound;500, and another (Lord
Alvanley?) &pound;200. Bishop Tomline and Rose showed equal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>activity and tact in raising this sum of &pound;11,700, so that the
details remained unknown to Pitt.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> Later on he felt pecuniary
embarrassments, partly owing to his share in maintaining the
Cinque Ports Volunteers, and at his death his debts amounted
to &pound;40,000.</p>

<p>His relations to his bankers, Messrs. Coutts, continued cordial,
though on 24th April 1805 Thomas Coutts ventured to
state that there was an overdraft against him of &pound;1,511, which,
however, was redressed by the arrival of his quarterly official
stipends.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> Pitt's loyalty to his friends appears in his effort during
his second Ministry to procure the royal assent to his nomination
of Bishop Tomline to the Archbishopric of Canterbury shortly
after the death of Dr. Moore early in 1805. The King, however,
who did not admire Tomline, and believed the Bishop of Norwich
to have prior claims, refused his reiterated requests. Pitt's second
letter to the King on this subject is couched in terms almost of
remonstrance.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p>Reverting to Pitt's life at Walmer, we find that in the summer
of 1802 he fell a prey to nausea and lassitude; so that Lady
Hester Stanhope, who visited him in September, found him very
weak. Probably his indisposition was due less to the exceptional
heat of that season than to suppressed gout aggravated by
anxiety. As we saw, he invited Addington to come over from
Eastbourne and discuss public affairs. The conference seems to
have caused him much concern; for Tomline in July 1802 jotted
down notes of a conversation with Pitt, in which Addington is
described as "without exception the vainest man he (Pitt) had
ever met with." Pitt's advice had often been asked before the
Preliminaries of Peace were signed, but afterwards he was neglected.
Cornwallis, too, had evidently believed that by the Treaty
of Amiens all former treaties with France were revived without
being named; and probably Ministers were under the same delusion.
The last King's Speech was also annoying to Pitt, who
characterized Addington as "a man of little mind, of consummate
vanity and of very slender abilities." As to resumption of
office Pitt thought it impossible during the life of the King, except
in case of some great emergency.<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span></p>
<p>Equally frank were Pitt's confessions to Canning, who stayed
at Walmer in September&ndash;October 1802. He admitted that his
resignation was due partly to the manner in which the King
opposed him on Catholic Emancipation. But he quitted office
with a clear conscience, leaving full means for attacking Egypt
and the Armed Neutrals, so that the reproaches of desertion of
duty were unjust. He pledged himself to support Addington;
and from this only Addington could release him. He admitted
that this was a mistake, now that current events showed
Bonaparte's ambition to be insatiable; but none the less he
waved aside Canning's reiterated appeals that he would apply to
Addington for release from the pledge, on the ground that such
a step would seem an intrigue for a return to power. "My
ambition (he proudly said) is character, not office."</p>

<p>Was a statesman ever placed in a more embarrassing situation?
Pitt had resigned office on a point of honour, and yet felt
constrained to humour the royal invalid by abandoning the very
measure which caused his resignation. Incautiously he pledged
himself to support Addington, thereby alienating some of his
own supporters. He defended his pacific policy until it led to a
bad treaty followed by a series of humiliations. By October
1802 Bonaparte was master of four Republics bordering on
France, and had annexed Piedmont and Elba, besides securing
Parma and Louisiana by profitable exchanges. Such a peace
was worse than a disastrous war. Yet Addington made no protest
except against the virtual subjugation of Switzerland. True,
the Cabinet now clung to the Cape and Malta as for dear life;
but elsewhere the eye could see French influence creeping resistlessly
over Europe, while the German Powers were intent only on
securing the spoils of the Ecclesiastical States. Well might Pitt
write to Wilberforce on 31st October: "You know how much
under all the circumstances I wished for peace, and my wishes
remain the same, if Bonaparte can be made to feel that he is not
to trample in succession on every nation in Europe. But of this
I fear there is little chance, and without it I see no prospect but
war." Worst of all, there were sure signs that France and the
other Powers distrusted and despised Addington. Vorontzoff,
the Russian ambassador, declared that he would work hard to
form an alliance with Pitt, but despaired of effecting anything
with his successor.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> In truth, Pitt's excessive scrupulousness at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>the time of his resignation had enclosed himself and his country
in a vicious circle from which the only means of escape was war.</p>

<p>A prey to these harassing thoughts, Pitt left Walmer near
the close of October 1802 to take the waters at Bath. On the
way he visited Sir Charles Middleton at Teston in Kent, and
sought distraction by inquiries on farming. Middleton wrote to
Wilberforce on 26th October: "His inquiries were very minute
and judicious; and it is incredible how quickly he comprehended
things, and how much further he reasons on them than I can
follow him.... I believe Mr. Pitt has it in his power to become the
first farmer in England if he thinks the pursuit worth his time
and attention."<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> The treatment at Bath suited Pitt so well that
he prolonged his stay. Rose, whom he invited to Bath in the
second week of November, thus describes to Bishop Tomline his
manner of life:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Bath, <i>Nov. 21, 1802</i>.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Pitt's health mends every day: it is really better than it has been
ever since I knew him. I am quite sure this place agrees with him
<em>entirely</em>, he eats a small [<i>illegible</i>] and a half for breakfast, and more at
dinner than I ever saw him at 1/2 past 4: no luncheon: two very small
glasses of Madeira at dinner and <em>less</em> than a pint of port after dinner:
at night, nothing but a bason of arrowroot: he is positively in the best
possible train of management for his health.... He is positively
decided to have no responsibility whatever respecting what has been
done or is doing on the subject of foreign politics; he not only adheres
to his resolution of not going up for the opening [of Parliament]; but
will not attend even on the estimates unless a necessity should arise:
he writes to day both to Mr. Addington and Lord Hawkesbury in a
style that will not only manifest the above, <em>but will prevent all further
attempts to draw him into confidential communication</em>. He has also
made up his mind to take office again whenever the occasion shall
arise, when he can come in properly, and has now no reluctance on the
subject. I dare not say more by the Post. If my letter is opened, the
Ministers will know the first part is true, and I don't care about their
learning the latter. Lord Grenville will positively not take a line to
render it difficult for Mr. Pitt and him to act together; he will move no
amendment to the Address....</p>
</div>


<p>Rose, as we have seen, disliked Lord Auckland, who was joint
Postmaster-General; and if Pitt's letters were opened at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>Post Office, we can understand the thinness of his correspondence.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
Recently he had advised Addington not to retain Alexandria,
Malta, Goree, and Cape Town, but to trust rather to
defensive preparations, which might include a friendly understanding
with other aggrieved Powers. This surely was the
dignified course. Even Malta was not worth the risk of immediate
war unless we were ready both with armaments and
alliances. The foregoing letter, however, shows that Pitt believed
his advice to be useless. Possibly he heard that the Cabinet had
decided to retain those posts; and finally, as we shall see, Pitt
approved their action in the case of Malta. Meanwhile matters
went from bad to worse. Ministers complained of Pitt's aloofness;
but his friends agreed that he must do nothing to avert
from Addington the consequences of his own incompetence.
Even the cold Grenville declared Pitt to be the only man who
could save England. But could even he, when under an incompetent
chief, achieve that feat?</p>

<p>For by this time Addington had hopelessly deranged the
nation's finance. While giving up Pitt's drastic Income Tax,
which had not brought in the expected &pound;10,000,000 but a net
sum of &pound;6,000,000, he raised the Assessed Taxes by one third,
increased Import and Export duties with impartial rigour, and
yet proposed to raise &pound;5,000,000 by Exchequer Bills, which were
to be funded at the end of the Session or paid off by a loan. This
signal failure to meet the year's expenses within the year exasperated
Pitt. At Christmas, which he spent with Rose at his
seat in the New Forest, he often conversed on this topic; and
his host thus summed up his own conclusions in a letter to
Bishop Tomline:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Cuffnells, <i>December 24, 1802</i>.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></p>

<p>... There is hardly a part of the Budget that is not too stupidly
wrong even for the doctor's dullness and ignorance. I am sure Mr. Pitt
must concur with me; and I have all the materials for him.&mdash;Wrong
about the increase of the revenue; wrong as to the produce of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>Consolidated Fund; scandalously wrong as to what is to be expected
from it in future by at least &pound;2,800,000 a year; wrong as to the money
he will want this year by millions....</p>
</div>


<p>During his stay at Cuffnells Pitt received a letter from
Addington urging the need of an interview. Viewing the
request as a sign of distress with which he must in honour
comply, Pitt agreed to stay a few days early in January 1803 at
the White Lodge in Richmond Park, which the King had for the
time assigned to his favoured Minister. Addington described him
as looking far from well, though his strength had improved and
his spirits and appetite were good.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> Apparently Pitt found the
instruction of his host in finance a subject as dreary as the
winter landscape. He afterwards told Rose that Addington
mooted his entrance to the Cabinet awkwardly during their
farewell drive to town. But this does not tally with another
account, which is that Pitt, on the plea of winding up the
transfer of Holwood, suddenly left the White Lodge on 6th
January. On the 11th he wrote from Camden's seat, The
Wilderness, in Kent, that his views on foreign affairs were
nearly in accord with those of the Cabinet, but that he failed to
convince Addington of his financial error.</p>

<p>This, then, was still the rock of offence. Nevertheless, Pitt
begged Rose not to attack the Cabinet on that topic, as it would
embarrass him. If it were necessary on public grounds to set
right the error, he (Pitt) would do so himself on some fit
occasion. Malmesbury and Canning did their utmost to spur
him on to a more decided opposition; and the latter wrote him
a letter of eight pages "too admonitory and too fault-finding for
even Pitt's very good humoured mind to bear."<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> Pitt replied by
silence. In vain did friends tell him that Ministers had assured
the King of his intention to bring forward Catholic Emancipation
if he returned to office. In vain did Malmesbury declare
that Pitt must take the helm of State, otherwise Fox would do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>so. In vain did Rose predict the country's ruin from Addington's
appalling ignorance of finance. Pitt still considered himself in
honour bound to support Addington. At the close of January
he held friendly converse with him, before setting out for Walmer
for a time of rest and seclusion. Canning's only consolation was
that Bonaparte would come to their help, and by some new act
of violence end Pitt's scrupulous balancing between the claims
of national duty and of private obligations. The First Consul
dealt blow upon blow. Yet even so, Canning's hopes were long
to remain unfulfilled. As we saw in the former volume, the
relations of Pitt to Addington had for many years been of an
intimate nature; but occasions arise when a statesman ought
promptly to act upon the maxim of Mirabeau&mdash;"<span lang="fr">La petite morale
est ennemie de la grande.</span>" In subordinating the interests of
England to the dictates of a deep-rooted but too exacting
friendship, Pitt was guilty of one of the most fatal blunders of
that time.</p>

</p>


<p>On 30th January 1803 there appeared in the "Moniteur"
the official Report of Colonel Sebastiani, Napoleon's envoy
to the Levant. So threatening were its terms respecting the
situation in Egypt and Corfu, that the Addington Ministry at
once adopted a stiffer tone, and applied to Parliament for
10,000 additional seamen and the embodying of the militia.
But the House, while readily acceding on 9th March, evidently
wanted not only more men but a man. The return of Pitt
to power was anxiously discussed in the lobbies. The Duke
of Portland and Lord Pelham strongly expressed their desire
for it. Yet Pitt remained at Walmer, feeling that he could not
support financial plans fraught with danger to the State. Addington
therefore resolved to sound him again with a view to
his entering the Cabinet as a coadjutor. The envoy whom he
chose for this delicate mission was Henry Dundas, now Lord
Melville. He could count on his devotion; for, besides nominating
him for the peerage, he is said to have opened to his gaze
a life of official activity and patronage as First Lord of the
Admiralty in place of the parsimonious and unmannerly St.
Vincent.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> Pitt received his old friend at Walmer with a shade
of coolness in view of his declaration, on quitting office, that he
could accept no boon whatever from Addington. To come now
as his Cabinet-maker argued either overwhelming patriotism
or phenomenal restlessness.</p>

</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the two friends resumed at Walmer the festive
intercourse of the Wimbledon days; and in due course, after
dinner and wine, Melville broached the subject of his visit. It
was that Addington, who was First Lord of the Treasury and
Chancellor of the Exchequer, should resign the latter office to
Pitt, and take Lord Pelham's place as Secretary of State for
Home Affairs. We can picture the astonishment and wrath of
Pitt as this singular proposal came to light. At once he cut
short the conversation, probably not without expletives. But
Melville was pertinacious where patriotism and office were at
stake; and their converse spread over the two days, 21st&ndash;22nd
March, Melville thereupon sending a summary of it to Addington,
couched in terms which Pitt deemed too favourable. The
upshot was that on personal grounds Pitt desired not to return
to office; and, if affairs were efficiently conducted, would prefer
to continue his present independent support. If, however,
the misleading statements of the Treasury were persisted in, he
must criticize them. Above all, if he returned to office it must
be as First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<p>But Addington, foreseeing that Pitt would claim his two
former offices, had concocted a sovereign remedy for all these
personal sores. Pitt was to take office as Chancellor of the Exchequer,
serving under his brother, the Earl of Chatham, as
Prime Minister. Is it surprising that he negatived this singular
proposal "without reserve or affectation"? By way of retort to
this family prescription he charged Melville to point out the
absolute need of the Cabinet being under the control of "the First
Minister," who must not only have the confidence of the King and
administer the finances, but also in the last resort impose his will
on his colleagues. For himself he declared he would never come
forward unless bound by public duty and with the enjoyment of
the fullest confidence of the King.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> There is a discrepancy between
Melville's letter to Addington and a short account given
by Pitt to Wilberforce two years later, to the effect that Melville,
on cautiously opening his proposals at Walmer, saw that
it would not do and stopped abruptly. "Really," said Pitt with
a sly severity, "I had not the curiosity to ask what I was to be."</p>

<p>Such was the bomb-shell exploded on Addington's bureau on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>23rd March. It must have cost him no less concern than Bonaparte's
outrageous behaviour to our ambassador, Lord Whitworth,
ten days before. That scene before the diplomatic circle at the
Tuileries portended war. How would Addington and his colleagues
behave in this crisis? Would they sink all personal feelings,
and, admitting that they could not weather the storm,
accept the help and guidance of long tried navigators? Or would
they stand on their dignity and order the pilot-boat to sheer
off? Clearly it was a case where half measures were useless.
The old captain and his chosen subalterns must command the
ship. Pitt made this clear during conversations with Addington
at Long's house at Bromley Hill (10th April). While declaring
that he would not urge any point inconsistent with His
Majesty's intentions, he demanded that Grenville, Melville,
Spencer, and Windham should enter the Cabinet with him on
the clearly expressed desire of the King, and at the request of
the present Ministry. The last conditions seem severe. But
Pitt's pledge to Addington made it essential that the Prime
Minister should take the first step. To these terms two days
later Addington made demur, but promised to communicate
them to his colleagues; whereupon Pitt declared that he had
said the last word on the matter; and when Ministers objected
to Grenville and Windham, he was inexorable.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> That their anger
waxed hot against him appears from the following letter sent to
Pitt by Lord Redesdale, formerly Sir John Mitford, and now
Lord Chancellor of Ireland, who had been with Pitt and Addington
at their conferences at Bromley:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Albemarle St., <i>April 16, 1803</i>.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></p>

<p>What passed yesterday and the day before at Bromley Hill, has made
so strong an impression on my mind that I have been unable to relieve
myself from the anxiety which it has occasioned. However you may
flatter yourself to the contrary, it seems to me most clear that your return
into office, with the impression under which you have appeared to
act, must have the effect of driving from their situations every man now
in office, and making a greater change than has ever been made on
any similar occasion. I think myself as one of those persons individually
intitled to call upon your honour not to pursue the line of conduct
which you seem determined to adopt. The present Administration, so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>far from having been formed in hostility to you, was avowedly formed
of your friends. When you quitted office, you repeatedly declared that
you should consider yourself as obliged to those friends who would
continue in office or would accept office under Mr. Addington. You
must recollect that I expressed to you my disapprobation of the change
and my wish to retire to my situation at the Bar, quitting the office of
Attorney-General; and that you used to me these words&mdash;"That you
<em>must</em> not do, for my sake." The words were too strongly impressed
upon my mind at the moment to have escaped my memory. You encouraged
me to take the office of Speaker much against my will. If I
had not taken that office, nothing should have induced me to take that
in which I am now placed, and by which I have been brought into a
position of much anxiety, separated from all my old friends. Many
many others are in similar situations, and all are to be sacrificed to
those men who were said by yourself at the time to be acting in contradiction
to your wishes in quitting their offices or those who dragged
you out of office with them. You will probably tell me that you have
no such intentions, particularly with respect to myself. But, whatever
may be your intentions, such must be the unavoidable consequence of
the changes which you have determined upon. I thought, when I took
a situation under the Administration at the head of which you placed
Mr. Addington, that I was doing you service. It was of no small importance
to you, whether you looked to a return to office, or to retirement
from public life, that the Government should not fall into the
hands of those who had been engaged in violent opposition to you;
and you yourself stated to me that you apprehended that must be the
consequence if Mr. Addington should not be able to form an Administration....
Some of your last words to me induce me to think that
you have not yourself abandoned the plan formed for giving to the
Roman Catholic Church full establishment in Ireland&mdash;for such I consider
the plan suggested by Lord Castlereagh, with any modification of
which it is capable. Indeed, if all those who went out of office because
that measure was not approved then (such being the ostensible cause of
their quitting their stations) are to come into office again, there can be
no doubt in the mind of the public that it is determined to carry that
measure....</p>
</div>


<p>That at so critical a juncture a supporter of Addington, not
of Cabinet rank, should rake up personal reasons why Pitt
should let things drift to ruin is inconceivable. And did Redesdale
really believe Protestantism to be endangered by Pitt's
return to office, after his assurance at Bromley that he would
not press any point at variance with the royal resolves? The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
King, who knew Pitt far better than Redesdale did, had no fear
that he would belie his word by bringing forward Catholic
Emancipation. But the phrases in the letter quoted above show
that some of the Ministers were preparing to beat the drum
ecclesiastic, and, in the teeth of the evidence, to charge Pitt with
ingratitude and duplicity if he became Prime Minister. Ignoring
the national crisis, they concentrated attention solely on the
personal questions at issue; and it is humiliating to have to add
that their petty scheming won the day. A compromise between
Pitt and Addington was exceedingly difficult, but their reproaches
and innuendoes made it impossible.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></p>

<p>The outcome was disastrous. The failure to form a strong
and truly national Administration ended all hope of peace.
Over against Addington set Bonaparte; with Hawkesbury compare
Talleyrand; with Hobart, Berthier.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> The weighing need
go no further. The British Ministry kicks the beam; and in
that signal inequality is one of the chief causes of the war of
1803. The first Consul, like the Czar Alexander&nbsp;I, despised the
Addington Cabinet. He could not believe that men who were
laughed at by their own supporters would dare to face him in
arms. Twice he made the mistake of judging a nation by its
Ministers&mdash;England by Addington in 1803, Spain by Godoy in
1808. Both blunders were natural, and both were irreparable;
but those peoples had to pour forth their life blood to recover
the position from which weakness and folly allowed them to
slide. Politics, like meteorology, teaches that any sharp difference
of pressure, whether mental or atmospheric, draws in a
strong current to redress the balance. Never were the conditions
more cyclonic than in 1803. A decade of strife scarcely
made good the inequality between the organized might of
France and the administrative chaos of her neighbours; between
the Titanic Corsican and the mediocrities or knaves who held
the reins at London, Vienna, Berlin, and Madrid.</p>

<p>War having been declared on 18th May 1803, Pitt sought the
first opportunity of inspiriting Parliament and the nation. On
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>the 23rd a great concourse crowded the House in the hope of
hearing him speak; and cries of "Pitt, Pitt" arose as he strode
to his seat on the third row behind Ministers, beside one of the
pillars. The position gave point to a remark of Canning to
Lord Malmesbury, that Pitt would fire over the heads of
Ministers, neither praising nor blaming them, but merely supporting
the policy of the war. Such was the case. Replying to
a few criticisms of Erskine, he defended the Cabinet and powerfully
described the unbearable aggressions of the First Consul.</p>

<p>The speech aroused a patriotic fervour which cannot be fully
realized from the meagre and dreary summary of it which survives.
Romilly pronounced it among the finest, if not the very
finest, which he had ever made;<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> and Sheridan, in a vinous
effusion to Lady Bessborough, called it "one of the most
magnificent pieces of declamation that ever fell from that rascal
Pitt's lips. Detesting the dog, as I do, I cannot withhold this
just tribute to the scoundrel's talents." There follows a lament
over Pitt's want of honesty, which betokens the maudlin mood
preceding complete intoxication.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> On the morrow Fox vehemently
blamed the Cabinet in a speech which, for width of
survey, acuteness of dialectic, wealth of illustration and abhorrence
of war, stands unrivalled. Addington's reply exhibited
his hopeless mediocrity; but, thanks to Pitt, Ministers triumphed
by 398 votes to 67. As they resented the absence of definite
praise in his speech, he withdrew to Walmer, there to serve
his country and embarrass his finances by raising the Cinque
Ports Volunteers.</p>

<p>Before recounting Pitt's services in East Kent, I must mention
a bereavement which he had sustained. His mother died, after
a very short seizure, at Burton Pynsent on 3rd April 1803. Thus
was snapped a link connecting England with a mighty past. A
quarter of a century had elapsed since her consort was laid
to rest in the family vault in Westminster Abbey; she followed
him while the storm-fiends were shrouding in strife the two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>hereditary foes; and the Napoleonic War was destined to
bring her gifted son thither in less than three years. The father
had linked the name of Pitt with military triumphs; the son,
with futile efforts for peace and goodwill; but the lives both of
the war-lord and of the would-be peacemaker were to be ended
by tidings of national disaster.</p>


<p class="poem">
No parleying now. In Britain is one breath;<br />
We all are with you now from shore to shore;<br />
Ye men of Kent, 'tis victory or death!<br />
</p>


<p>We all know these lines of Wordsworth. Do we know equally
well that on Pitt, as Lord Warden, fell the chief burden of
organization on the most easily accessible coast, that which
stretches from Ramsgate to Rye?<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> It was defenceless but for
the antiquated works at Sandown, Deal, Walmer, Dover, and a
few small redoubts further west. Evidently men must be the
ramparts, and Pitt sought to stimulate the Volunteer Movement,
which now again made headway. He strove to make it a
National Movement. At the close of July he sent an official
offer to raise 3,000 Volunteers in Walmer and its neighbourhood;
and he urged Ministers to have recourse to a <span lang="fr">lev&eacute;e en
masse</span>, whereupon Yorke, Under Secretary at War, proposed a
scheme somewhat on those lines. Probably the encouragement
offered to Volunteers was too great; for, while they were required
to do less than was necessary to ensure efficiency, they
were freed from all risk of compulsory enrolment in the Militia.
This force and the Army consequently suffered, while the
Volunteer Associations grew apace. On 27th October 1803 the
King reviewed in Hyde Park as many as 27,000 of the London
Volunteers and showed his caustic wit by giving the nickname
of "the Devil's Own" to the Inns of Court Volunteers.</p>

<p>Pitt was not present on this occasion, he and his neighbour,
Lord Carrington, on whom in 1802 he bestowed the command
of Deal Castle, being busy in organizing the local Volunteers.
As Constable of Dover Castle, Pitt summoned the delegates of
the Cinque Ports to meet him there to discuss the raising of
local corps; and he gave the sum of &pound;1,000 towards their
expenses. Dover contributed &pound;885; Sandwich, &pound;887; Margate,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>&pound;538, and so on. As Lord Warden, he also took steps to secure
a large number of recruits for the new Army of Reserve, and he
further instructed local authorities to send in returns of all men
of military age, besides carts, horses, and stock, with a view to
the "driving" of the district in case of a landing.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> At Walmer
he kept open house for officers and guests who visited that coast.
By the end of the year 1803 more than 10,000 Kentishmen had
enrolled as Volunteers, and 1,040 in the Army of Reserve,
exclusive of Sea Fencibles serving on gunboats. For the whole
of Great Britain the totals were 379,000 and 31,000 respectively.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>
Pitt's joke at the expense of a battalion which laid more stress
on privileges than drills, has become historic. Its organizers
sent up a plan containing several stipulations as to their duties,
with exceptions "in case of actual invasion." Pitt lost patience
at this Falstaff-like conduct, and opposite the clause that they
were on no account to be sent out of the country he wrote the
stinging comment&mdash;"except in case of invasion."</p>

<p>The pen of Lady Hester Stanhope gives life-like glimpses of
him during the endless drills between Deal and Dover. She had
fled from the levelling vagaries of Earl Stanhope at Chevening
to Lady Chatham at Burton Pynsent; but that home being now
broken up, Pitt offered to install her at Walmer Castle. He did
so with some misgiving; for her queenly airs and sprightly
sallies, however pleasing as a tonic, promised little for comfort
and repose. But the experiment succeeded beyond all hope.
She soon learnt to admire his serenity, while his home was the
livelier for the coming of this meteoric being. Her complexion
was dazzlingly bright. Her eyes, usually blue, would flash black,
as did those of Chatham in moments of excitement. Her
features, too, had a magical play of expression, lighting up at a
pleasing fancy, or again darting forth scorn, with the April-like
alternations that irradiated and overclouded the brow of her
grandsire. Kinglake, who saw her half a century later in her
Syrian fastness, was struck by the likeness to the Chatham of
Copley's famous picture.</p>

<p>Certainly she had more in common with him than with the
younger Pitt. During the time when she brought storm and
sunshine to Walmer, Park Place, and Bowling Green House,
she often rallied her uncle on showing undue complaisance to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>the King or to stupid colleagues whom the Great Commoner
would have overawed. Pitt laughingly took the second place,
and at times vowed that when her voice rang with excitement,
he caught an echo of the tones of his father.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> Perhaps it was
this which reconciled him to her vagaries. For her whims and
moods even then showed the extravagance which made her the
dreaded Sultana of that lonely Syrian castle where she ended
her days amidst thirty quarrelsome but awe-struck servants,
and an equal number of cats, over whom an apprehensive doctor
held doubtful sway.</p>

<p>But that bitter, repining, spirit-haunted exile was far different
from the joyous creature who shed light on Pitt. Her spasmodic
nature needed his strength; her waywardness, his affectionate
control. As for her tart retorts, terrifying to bores and toadies,
they only amused him. In truth she brought into his life a beam
of the sunshine which might have flooded it had he married
Eleanor Eden. Hester soon found that, far from being indifferent
to the charms of women, he was an exacting judge of beauty,
even of dress. In fact, she pronounced him to be perfect in
household life. His abilities in gardening astonished her; and
we may doubt the correctness of the local legend which ascribes
to her the landscape-gardening undertaken in the grounds
of Walmer Castle in 1803. The dell at the top of the grounds
was Hester's favourite haunt.</p>

<p>The varied excitements of the time are mirrored in her
sprightly letters. Thus, on 15th November 1803, she wrote at
Walmer:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>We took one of their gunboats the other day: and, as soon as she
came in, Mr. Pitt, Charles,<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> Lord Camden and myself took a Deal boat
and rowed alongside of her. She had two large guns on board, 30
soldiers and 4 sailors. She is about 30 feet long, and only draws about
4 feet of water; an ill-contrived thing, and so little above the water
that, had she as many men on board as she could really carry, a
moderate storm would wash them overboard.... Mr. Pitt's 1st battalion
of his newly-raised regiment was reviewed the other day by
General Dundas, who expressed himself equally surprised and pleased
by the state of discipline he found them in.... I like all this sort of
thing, and I admire my uncle most particularly when surrounded with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>tribe of military attendants. But what is all this pageantry compared
with the unaffected simplicity of real greatness!</p>
</div>


<hr style="width: 10%" />


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Walmer Castle, <i>Nov. 19, 1803</i>.</p>

<p>To F. R. Jackson, Esq.</p>

<p>To express the kindness with which Mr. Pitt welcomed my return
and proposed my living with him would be impossible; one would
really suppose that all obligation was on his side. Here then am I,
happy to a degree; exactly in the sort of society I most like. There are
generally three or four men staying in the house, and we dine eight or
ten almost every other day. Military and naval characters are constantly
welcome here; women are not, I suppose, because they do not form any
part of our society. You may guess, then, what a pretty fuss they make
with me. Pitt absolutely goes through the fatigue of a drill sergeant. It
is parade after parade at 15 or 20 minutes' distance from each other. I
often attend him; and it is quite as much as I am equal to, although I
am remarkably well just now. The hard riding I do not mind, but to
remain almost <em>still</em> so many hours on horseback is an incomprehensible
bore, and requires more patience than you can easily imagine. However,
I suppose few regiments for the time were ever so forward; therefore
the trouble is nothing. If Mr. Pitt does not overdo and injure his
health every other consideration becomes trifling. [She then states her
anxiety on this score. She rarely speaks to him on it, as he particularly
dislikes it. She adds:] I am happy to tell you, sincerely, I see nothing
at all alarming about him. He had a cough when I first came to England,
but it has nearly or quite left him. He is thin, but certainly
strong, and his spirits are excellent.... Mr. Pitt is determined to
remain acting colonel when his regiment is called into the field.</p>
</div>


<p>On this topic Pitt met with a rebuff from General (afterwards
Sir John) Moore, commander of the newly formed camp at
Shorncliffe, near Folkestone. Pitt rode over from Walmer to
ask his advice, and his question as to the position he and his
Volunteers should take brought the following reply: "Do you
see that hill? You and yours shall be drawn up on it, where
you will make a most formidable appearance to the enemy,
while I with the soldiers will be fighting on the beach." Pitt
was highly amused at this professional retort; but at the close of
1804 his regiment was pronounced by General David Dundas
fit to take the field with regulars. Life in the open and regular
exercise on horseback served to strengthen Pitt's frame; for
Hester, writing in the middle of January 1804, when her uncle
was away in London for a few days, says: "His most intimate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
friends say they do not remember him so well since the year
'97.... Oh! such miserable things as these French gunboats.
We took a vessel the other day, laden with gin&mdash;to keep their
spirits up, I suppose." Bonaparte was believed to be at Boulogne;
and there was much alarm about a landing; but she was resolved
"not to be driven up country like a sheep."</p>

<p>This phrase refers to the arrangements for "driving" the
country, that is, sweeping it bare of everything in front of the
invaders. The plans for "driving" were thorough, but were finally
pronounced unworkable. His efforts to meet the Boulogne flotilla
were also most vigorous. On 18th October 1803 he informs Rose
that he had 170 gunboats ready between Hastings and Margate
to give the enemy a good reception whenever they appeared.
He adds: "Our Volunteers are, I think, likely to be called upon
to undertake permanent duty, which, I hope, they will readily
consent to. I suppose the same measure will be recommended
in your part of the coast [West Hants]. I wish the arrangements
for defence were as forward everywhere else as they are
in Hythe Bay under General Moore. We begin now to have no
other fear in that quarter than that the enemy will not give us
an opportunity of putting our preparations to the proof, and will
select some other point which we should not be in reach of in
the first instance." On 10th November he expresses a hope of
repelling any force that attempted to land in East Kent, but
fears that elsewhere the French cannot be stopped until they
arrive disagreeably near to London.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p>It is clear, then, that Pitt was not dismayed by the startling
disparity of forces. On the coast of Flanders and Picardy were
ranged regular troops amounting to 114,554 men seemingly
ready for embarkation on an immense flotilla of small craft, part
of which was heavily armed. It is now known that these imposing
forces were rarely, if ever, up to their nominal strength;
that part of the flotilla was unseaworthy; that the difficulties of
getting under way were never overcome; and that the unwieldy
mass would probably have been routed, if not destroyed, by the
cruisers and gunboats stationed on the Kentish coast. Still, even
if part of it made land, the crisis would be serious in view of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>paucity and want of organization of the British forces. As bearing
on this subject, a letter of Lord Melville to a relative deserves
quotation:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">"Dunira, <i>16 Dec., 1803</i>.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Alexander</span>,</p>

<p>"I received your letter from Walmer and was extreamly happy
to learn from it that Mr. Pitt was in such excellent health. Long, I pray,
may it continue. He has been very usefully and creditably employed,
but not exactly in the way his country could have wished; but that is a
subject on which I never now allow myself to think.... If Mr. Pitt,
from what he feels within himself or from the enthusiasm he may have
inspired in those he commands, conceives that the defence of the
country could at any time be safely entrusted with the Volunteers alone,
as the newspapers seem to convey as his sentiments, he is by much too
sanguine. On the other hand it is talking wildly, or like old women, to
contend, as Mr. Windham and Mr. Fox do, that great bodies of Britains
[<span lang="la">sic</span>], with arms in their hands and trained to the use of them, are not a
most important bulwark of security to the Empire. My opinion, however,
lays perhaps in the middle, and I would have greatly preferred a
much smaller number to have secured more effectually their uniform
efficiency. I would much rather have had 200,000 on the footing of
Lord Hobart's first letter in June than double that number selected and
formed in the loose and desultory manner they have more recently been
under the variety of contradictory orders they have since received and
by which Government have annoyed every corner of the country."
Melville adds that they would be useful if thoroughly trained and not
allowed to leave their corps; but exemptions from the Militia and Army
of Reserve ballots granted to the recent Volunteer Corps are mischievous,
and interfere with the recruiting. The Militia is unnecessarily large
and interferes with recruiting for the regular army. He would have
enough trained troops at home to be able to send abroad "50,000
infantry for offensive operations either by ourselves or in co-operation
with such European Powers as may recover their senses, as sooner or
later they must and will do."</p>
</div>


<p>Pitt did not leave his post for long, except when high winds
made an invasion impossible. At such times he would make a
trip to London. A short sojourn in town in the early spring
elicits from Lady Hester the words: "I cannot but be happy
anywhere in Mr. Pitt's society"; and she hoped that she helped
to amuse and entertain him. Certainly Pitt did his utmost to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>enliven her stay at the little residence at Park Place. In the
Memoirs of the Comtesse de Boigne, who claims to have known
her well, we catch a glimpse of Pitt acting as <span lang="fr">chaperon</span> at balls
which obviously bored him. Yet he would patiently wait there
until, perhaps, four a.m., when Lady Hester returned to end his
<span lang="fr">ennui</span>. Is it surprising that after his death she called him that
adored angel?</p>

<hr />

<p>Early in the year 1804 a ministerial crisis seemed at hand.
The personal insignificance of Ministers, the hatred felt for
St. Vincent at the Admiralty, the distrust of Hobart at the
War Office, and the deep depression caused by the laboured infelicities
of Addington's speeches presaged a breakdown. So
threatening was the outlook that Grenville urged Pitt to combine
with him for the overthrow of an Administration which palsied
national energy. For reasons which are far from clear, Pitt
refused to take decisive action. During his stay in London in
mid-January he saw Grenville, but declined to pledge himself to
a definite opposition. Grenville and his coadjutors, among them
Lord Carysfort, were puzzled by this wavering conduct, which
they ascribed to <span lang="fr">finesse</span>, pettiness, or even to insincerity.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> But it is
clear that Pitt objected only to their proposed methods, which he
termed a teasing, harassing opposition. In vain did the Bishop
of Lincoln, who came to town at Pitt's request, seek to reconcile
their differences. The most to be hoped for was that Pitt would
be compelled by force of circumstances to concert a plan with
the Grenvilles for Addington's overthrow. The following letter
of Carysfort to the bishop is of interest:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter"><i>Jan<sup>y</sup>. 18, 1804</i>.<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a></p>

<p>Lord Grenville and Mr. Pitt being agreed upon so material a point
as the necessity of removing Mr. A[ddington] from his present situation,
it must be a matter not only of regret but of surprise, that they should
not be able to reconcile any difference of opinion between them as to
the sort of opposition to be carried on in Parliament; and I cannot
help thinking that Mr. Pitt's avowal that he intends opposition would in
itself be sufficient to incline (not merely Lord Grenville and his friends,
who have made it a principal object to be united with Mr. Pitt and
place him again at the head of affairs) but all the parties who may mean
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>to oppose, to leave the mode pretty much at his option!... [Your
letter] leads me to think that Mr. Pitt and he may not have understood
each other. Lord Grenville's attachment to Mr. Pitt has been so conspicuous,
and I am persuaded his communications have been so frank
and so explicit, that I cannot account for Mr. Pitt using any reserve
with him, and must be of opinion that greater openness, where there is
such solid ground of confidence, would lead to more satisfactory results.
[Lord Carysfort then says that Pitt should not keep public opinion so
long in suspense; for] the public danger from a Ministry confessedly
incapable is already great and urgent and will be continually increasing.</p>
</div>


<p>Failing to get help from Pitt, Grenville, at the end of January,
sought the help of Fox! Through his brother, Thomas Grenville,
as go-between he offered the Whig leader his alliance for
the overthrow of Addington and the formation of a Ministry of
the talented men of all parties. Here, then, is the origin of the
broad-bottomed or All the Talents Administrations which produced
so singular a muddle after the death of Pitt. The Fox&ndash;Grenville
bargain cannot be styled immoral like that of Fox
and North in 1782; for it expressly excluded all compromise on
matters of conviction. Nevertheless it was a tactical mistake,
for which Pitt's exasperating aloofness was largely responsible.
Few occurrences in this time of folly and blundering were more
untoward. Pitt's letter of 4th February to Grenville shows that
he discerned the magnitude of the error, little though he saw
his own share in it. The result of the union of Fox and
Grenville was likely to be the fall of Addington, an appeal of
the King to him (Pitt) to form a Cabinet, which would be
narrowed and weakened by the present effort of Grenville to
form a strong and comprehensive Administration.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>

<p>Presumably the national crisis was not yet acute enough to
satisfy Pitt that he might conscientiously oppose Addington.
But that he was drifting to this <span class="ins" title="convicton">conviction</span> appears in the following
letter from Rose to the Bishop of Lincoln.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter"><i>Feb. 11, 1804</i>.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>

<p>I showed Mr. Pitt your letter because it expressed so entirely my own
view of the interesting subject: he appeared at first against anything
like hostility, but I think is now disposed to point out pretty strongly
the neglect of proper measures of defence in the naval and military departments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
and to suggest the necessary ones; so [as] to throw on the
Government the just responsibility and odium of rejecting them if they
shall determine to do so.</p>
</div>


<p>Rose then states that the Bishop of St. Asaph calls the new
Volunteer Bill "the most wishy-washy thing that ever was
produced." He also adds that the King is ill, probably of
dropsy. The fact was even worse. A chill caught in drenching
rain developed into the former mental malady. Thus the nation
was for a time kingless, leaderless, and open to a deadly thrust
from Boulogne. For a short time his life was in danger, and all
the troubles of a Regency loomed ahead. The Prince of Wales
having ventured on the compromising prophecy that the illness
"<em>must</em> last several months," Pitt quoted to his informant,
Malmesbury, the damning line</p>


<p class="poem">
Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought.
</p>


<p>In truth, there now began a series of intrigues, in which the
Prince, Fox, and the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire played
the leading parts, for assuring a Regency and the formation of a
Fox Administration. While England needed to keep her gaze
on Boulogne, the intriguers thought only of the death or lunacy
of the King, the accession of the Prince and the apportionment
of the spoils of office. Sheridan on this occasion played his own
game and for this was heartily cursed by the expectant Creevey.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

<p>In view of these last complications and the prospect of an invasion,
Pitt revised his former judgement, and informed Malmesbury
that, while declining the offers of the Grenvilles to help to
overthrow Addington, he would not refuse to take office if for any
reason Ministers resigned. On that day (19th February) Melville
wrote to him from Melville Castle that the outlook was full of
horror, and everything depended on the formation of a steady
and permanent Government with which foreign nations could
treat. For this reason he (Melville) urged that the King should
be relieved of his executive duties, which it was sheer cruelty to
exact from him.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> Pitt's answer to this daring proposal is not
known; but later, on 29th March, in answer to further overtures
from Melville, he stated that the King's illness was less serious
than was reported by the Earl of Moira, the <span lang="fr">confidante</span> of the
Prince of Wales; and that while it lasted he doubted the propriety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
of taking any steps to overturn the Ministry.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> To this
scrupulousness Melville was a stranger, and on 4th April again
urged him to form a compact opposition for the overthrow of
Addington, and promised him the votes of at least twenty-six
Scottish members (out of forty-five) for any such effort.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the King recovered but slowly. The nervous,
excited, irritable symptoms showed little abatement; and in
the third week in March he fell into a fit of anger of such
violence that he had to be strapped to his bed. Even more
threatening was the military situation. Yorke, early in March,
proposed a Volunteer Consolidation Bill, which met with general
derision. As the state of the Navy was also unsatisfactory, Pitt
freely criticized Ministers, especially St. Vincent; and, on one
occasion, when Addington showed boyish petulance, he met with
a serene and courteous answer. Tierney, Treasurer of the Navy,
attacked Pitt coarsely; Sheridan, with his usual wit and brilliance;
but neither coarseness nor eloquence could rehabilitate
that Ministry. The urgency of the crisis appears in the following
letter written by Pitt at Walmer Castle to some person unknown:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter"><i>April 11, 1804</i>.</p>

<p>... The experience of the last summer and the discussions of this
session confirm me in the opinion that while the Government remains
in its present shape and under its present leader, nothing efficient can
be expected either to originate with them or to be fairly adopted and
effectually executed. With this persuasion, and thinking that a system
of more energy and decision is indispensable with a view to the immediate
crisis and the many difficulties he may have to encounter in the
course of the present contest, I mean to take an early opportunity of
avowing and acting on these sentiments more explicitly and decidedly
than I have hitherto done; and I shall endeavour to give effect to my
opinion by the support of all the friends whom I can collect. My object
will be to press to the utmost those points which I think essential to the
public defence, and at the same time in doing so to make it, if I can,
impossible for the present Government to maintain itself. In this
object I have every reason to believe that I shall have the fullest concurrence
of all those with whom I have the most differed on former
occasions and with whom possibly I may as little agree in future. With
their number added to my own more immediate friends, and to the few
who have acted with L<sup>d</sup> Grenville and Windham, I am persuaded that our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>division on any favourable question will probably be such as would be
sufficient to shake a much stronger Government than the present....<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a></p>
</div>


<p>On the same day he promised Melville to return to town in
the middle of April, and to make the "principal push" against
Addington on 23rd April, on the subject of Yorke's Bill for
suspending the completion of the Army Reserve. If they failed,
he would return to Walmer for another kind of contest. The
joint assault by Fox and Pitt against the Ministry on 23rd
April produced a great sensation, the speech of Pitt being
remarkable for its suppressed sarcasm and thinly veiled charges
of inefficiency. As a call to arms, it stands without a rival.
Ministers were utterly beaten in argument, and escaped defeat
only by thirty-seven votes. Addington became alarmed, and
advised the King, who was now convalescent, to instruct the
Lord Chancellor, Eldon, to confer with Pitt, a fact which refutes
the charges of Brougham and Dean Pellew against Eldon.</p>

<p>Finally the King allowed Pitt to make proposals concerning
a new Ministry. Pitt did so fully and courteously in a paper
which George&nbsp;III forthwith described to Eldon as containing
"many empty words and little information." To Pitt himself
the King, on 5th May, expressed his deep regret that he had
taken such a dislike to Mr. Addington, after the praiseworthy
services of the latter to our glorious Constitution in Church and
State. He could never forget the wound which Pitt proposed to
deal it, and "the indelicacy (not to call it worse) of wanting His
Majesty to forego his solemn Coronation Oath." He therefore
required Pitt to give a solemn pledge not to propose the least
alteration in the Test Act. As to a proposal to admit Fox to
the Cabinet, the King expressed "his astonishment that Mr.
Pitt should one moment harbour the thought of bringing such a
man before his Royal notice." References to the "wild ideas"
of Burke, and to Grenville being guided by obstinacy, "his
usual director," filled up the interstices of this strange composition.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>
Evidently the enfeebled brain of George could form
no notion of the national danger. While Pitt thought only of
the safety of England, the King's thoughts continued to gyrate
angrily around the Test Act, the Coronation Oath, and the
iniquities of Fox.</p>

<p>It was therefore with grave apprehension that on 7th May
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>Pitt went to Buckingham House for attendance upon the King,
the first for nearly three and a quarter years. He expected an
outburst of rage when he mentioned the chief subject at issue,
namely the inclusion of Fox and the Grenvilles in the future
Administration. The King, however, kept surprising control
over his feelings, behaved graciously to Pitt, tactfully waived
aside smaller questions that he disliked, even consented to admit
the Grenvilles, but for ever barred the way to the return of Fox.
The utmost that he would hear was the employment of Fox as
an ambassador. Once again, then, the royal convalescent outwitted
Pitt. "Never," said Pitt to Eldon, "in any conversation I
have had with him in my life has he so baffled me." Fox being
excluded by the King, there was scant hope of bringing in his new
allies, the Grenvilles and Windham. Pitt broached the matter to
Lord Grenville on 7th May, and received on the morrow a friendly
but firm refusal. The following sentences are noteworthy: "We
rest our determination solely on our strong sense of the impropriety
of our becoming parties to a system of Government which
is to be formed at such a moment as the present on a principle
of exclusion.... We see no hope of any effectual remedy for
those mischiefs but by uniting in the public service as large a
proportion as possible of the weight, talents, and character to be
found in public men of all descriptions and without any exception."</p>

<p>The refusal of Grenville to join Pitt has often been ascribed
to jealousy of Pitt, and the latter is reported to have said that he
would teach that proud man that he could do without him.
The sentiment is alien to the tolerant nature of Pitt,<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> who
must have respected his cousin's decision, based as it was on a
determination to break down the bigoted resolve of the King.
But Grenville's conduct punished Pitt far more severely than the
King. For while George in his feeble, irritable condition thought
only about the Test Act and Fox, Pitt was intent on forming a
truly national Administration, including Fox, Fitzwilliam, and
Melville as Secretaries of State, with Spencer at the Admiralty,
Grenville as Lord President, and Windham as Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<p>The actual result was far inferior. Fox, Fitzwilliam, Spencer,
Grenville, and Windham being ruled out by the King's action
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>and Grenville's resolve, the Cabinet was formed as follows: Pitt,
First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer;
Harrowby, Foreign Secretary; Hawkesbury, Home Secretary;
Camden, Secretary at War and for the Colonies; Portland, Lord
President; Eldon, Lord Chancellor; Westmorland, Privy Seal;
Melville, Admiralty; Chatham, Master of Ordnance; Mulgrave,
Duchy of Lancaster; Castlereagh, President of the India Board;
the Duke of Montrose, President of the Board of Trade. Of
these twelve Ministers, six had been with Addington, namely,
Hawkesbury (though at the Foreign Office, which he unwillingly
vacated), Portland, Eldon, Westmorland, Chatham, and
Castlereagh.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> Pitt dispensed with the services of Addington, St.
Vincent, and Pelham. Of non-Cabinet appointments, the chief
were those of the Earl of Hardwicke as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland;
Sir Evan Nepean, Irish Secretary; William Dundas, War
Office; Canning, Treasury of the Navy, in place of Tierney, who
declined to serve with Pitt; Lord Charles Somerset and George
Rose, Joint Paymasters of the Forces; and Perceval, Attorney-General.
Canning and Rose were dissatisfied with their appointments,
the latter writing to Bishop Tomline in deep chagrin at
Pitt's neglect of his faithful services.</p>

<p>The new Cabinet, besides being too large, was half Addingtonian
and half Pittite, a source of weakness which soon led to
further changes. It was also weighted with inefficient members&mdash;Chatham,
Hawkesbury, and Portland. The King disliked Hawkesbury,
and said he had no head for business, no method, and no
punctuality. Harrowby, though a man of brilliant parts in
private life, and an excellent speaker, was oppressed by a delicate
frame, precarious health, and a peevish temper. During
no small part of his tenure of office he had to take the waters at
Bath, and was therefore a poor substitute for the experienced
and hard-working Grenville. Pitt, for some unexplained reason,
disliked placing Melville at the Admiralty, a strangely prophetic
instinct. Camden and Mulgrave were also misfits. Hawkesbury
did better work at the Home Office than the Foreign Office;
but on the whole, the new arrangement aroused widespread
grumbling and distrust. The result of it all was the dissolution
of the great national party formed in the year 1794 and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>formation of three groups, following Pitt, Addington, and Grenville,
the Addingtonians showing much bitterness at the treatment
of their chief, while the Grenvilles and Windham inveighed
against the new Ministry, as formed on the principle of excluding
Fox.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> The charge was unfair; for at that crisis Pitt could
not stand by and see the national resources frittered away by
Addington. The King's Government had to be carried on; and,
like Wellington a generation later, Pitt consented to do so in the
only way which was practicable.</p>

<p>The limitations of his power were soon obvious. The two unfriendly
groups eagerly criticized him at all times and accorded
grudging and doubtful support even on measures which they
approved. This was especially the case with regard to the
Abolition of the Slave Trade. Thanks to the untiring exertions
of Wilberforce, Clarkson, and others, that movement had made
considerable progress during the interval of peace. The outbreak
of war in May 1803 darkened the outlook; for once again
the cry was raised that England must not cut off a trade which
was essential to the welfare of the West Indies, highly lucrative
to British shipowners, and a necessary adjunct to the mercantile
marine. Nevertheless, the accession of Pitt to power and the
goodwill of the majority of the Irish members inspired Wilberforce
with hope. True, Addington always strenuously opposed
him; and among the younger members of the Cabinet Castlereagh
had declared his hostility; but at first all went well. At
the close of May 1804 Pitt and Fox united in expressing
approval of Wilberforce's proposals. Addington, in remarks
which lasted exactly forty seconds, scouted the measure, but
carried with him only 49 members as against 124. The majorities
were nearly as great at the second and third readings.</p>

<p>In the Lords the omens were inauspicious. Some bishops
were away in their dioceses: the supporters of the West India and
shipping interests were at hand, using their utmost endeavours to
delay, if not to defeat, the measure. Pitt despaired of thwarting
these dilatory tactics, backed by wealth and influence from all
quarters. Wilberforce wrote indignantly to Lord Muncaster:
"It was truly humiliating to see four of the Royal Family come
down to vote against the poor, helpless, friendless slaves." A
wild speech by Stanhope told against the cause which he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>meant to further, and the motion was adjourned to avoid
defeat.</p>

<p>Pitt's subsequent conduct in 1805 disappointed Wilberforce.
Certainly it was half-hearted and procrastinating. But, seeing
that he had to rely more on Addington and finally to bring him
into the Cabinet, his difficulties were great. The Irish members
also showed signs of defection; and it was certain that the Bill
would fail in the Lords. Accordingly, Pitt begged Wilberforce
to wait for a more propitious time. A sense of religious duty
impelled him to persevere, with the inevitable result, a crushing
defeat (19th February 1805).<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> On a smaller question, connected
with the prohibition of the supply of slaves to Guiana, then
recently conquered from the Dutch, he finally brought Pitt to
acquiesce. But here again the conduct of the Minister was tardy.
Wilberforce urged Pitt to abolish the Guiana Slave Trade by
an Order in Council, and early in May wrote: "One very powerful
and important reason for your abolishing the Guiana Slave
Trade by an act of Government, not by, or in consequence of a
vote of Parliament, is that it would tend to confirm the disposition
so strongly manifested by the Dutch to abolish the
Slave Trade, and give them the sort of compensation they
demand." The British Order in Council did not appear until
13th September 1805.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, their friendship remained firm to the end. "Had
much talk with him [Pitt] on political topics, finding him very
open and kind." Such is Wilberforce's account of his last interviews
with Pitt; and he certainly could not have remained on
friendly terms with one who was deliberately untrue to the cause.
He knew better than recent critics the difficulties resulting from
the compromise with Addington and from the ceaseless friction
with the followers of Fox and Grenville.</p>

<p>The case of the Slave Trade serves to illustrate the peculiar
difficulties of Pitt's position, which were to appear on even more
important questions. The King, Addington, Grenville, and Pitt
had all contributed to the tangle. Limiting our survey to the
conduct of Addington and Pitt, we must pronounce both of them
culpable. Addington should have seen that Pitt's promise of
support, given at the time of the King's lunacy in February&ndash;March
1801, was not morally binding three years later when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>the existence of the nation was at stake in the Napoleonic War.
At such a time an enlightened patriot does not stand upon
punctilio, but gladly takes a second place if he can thereby place
in authority an abler man. Addington alone could release Pitt
from the debt of honour incurred in February 1801, and faithfully
discharged for three weary years, at the cost of the alienation of
friends and the derision of opponents. He never spoke or wrote
that word of release, but held Pitt to the bargain with an insistence
which would be contemptible were it not in large measure
the outcome of a narrow complacent nature blind to its own
shortcomings.</p>

<p>Pitt, also, behaved weakly. The original promise, to support
an untried man, was a piece of astounding trustfulness; and
when the weakness of Addington's Administration involved the
nation in war and brought it to the brink of disaster, he should
openly have claimed release from a pledge too hastily given,
leaving the world to judge between them. As it was, for nearly
a year he wavered to and fro between the claims of national
duty and private honour, thereby exasperating his friends and
finally driving the Grenvilles, Windham, and Spencer to a union
with Fox which in its turn blighted the hope of forming a
national Administration. Finally, he made only one effort to
induce the King to accept Fox. True, the situation was a
delicate one; for pressure brought to bear on George on that
topic would have brought back the mental malady. But the
Grenvilles, viewing the situation with pedantic narrowness,
considered the attempt so half-hearted as to warrant their
opposition to the new Cabinet. On the whole, then, Pitt's
punctiliousness must be pronounced a secondary but vital cause
of the lamentable <span lang="fr">d&eacute;nouement</span>, which left him exposed at forty
five years of age, enfeebled by worry and gout, to a contest with
Napoleon at the climax of his powers.</p>

<p class="title spaced">PITT AND NAPOLEON</p>

<p class="quote">I made a mistake about England, in trying to conquer it. The English
are a brave nation. I have always said that there are only two nations, the
English and the French; and I made the French.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Napoleon to Macnamara</span>
(1814), <i>Lord Broughton's Recollections</i>, i, 180.</p>


<p>The two protagonists now stood face to face&mdash;Napoleon,
Emperor of the French, President of the Italian Republic,
Mediator of the Swiss Republic, controller of Holland, absolute
ruler of a great military Empire; Pitt, the Prime Minister of an
obstinate and at times half-crazy King, dependent on a weak
Cabinet, a disordered Exchequer, a Navy weakened by ill-timed
economies, and land forces whose martial ardour ill made up for
lack of organization, equipment, and training. Before the outbreak
of war in May 1803, Napoleon had summed up the situation
in the words&mdash;"Forty-five millions of people must prevail
over sixteen millions." And now after a year of hostilities his
position was far stronger. In Hanover the French troops were
profitably installed on the Elector's domains. Soult's corps
occupied the Neapolitan realm, thus threatening Malta, the
Ionian Isles, the Morea, and Egypt. The recent restitution of
several colonial conquests by England not only damaged her
trade, but enabled her enemy to stir up trouble in India. There,
thanks to Wellesley's dramatic victory at Assaye, the Union
Jack waved in triumph; but at other points Napoleon might
hope to gain the long contested race for Empire.</p>

<p>So convinced was Pitt of the need of fighting out the quarrel
thrust upon us by Napoleon's aggressions, that he waved aside
an offer of Livingston, American envoy at Paris, to effect a reconciliation.
During a brief visit to London, Livingston sent
proposals to this effect through Whitworth, who declined to meet
a man hitherto remarkable for a strong anti-British bias; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
Pitt approved this repulse.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> Nevertheless, on 5th June Livingston,
accompanied by Fox and Grey, called on Pitt at Downing
Street; but his proposals proved to be merely the outcome of
informal conversations with Joseph Bonaparte, who was known
to be far more peacefully inclined than his brother. Joseph's
notions were that Malta should perhaps be garrisoned by Russians,
and must in any case be relinquished by England; that
France should withdraw her troops from the Dutch and Swiss
Republics, the status of which was not defined.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> Pitt set little
store by these shadowy proposals, doubtless seeing in them a
way of discovering whether England was concerting a league
against France.</p>

<p>Already, in spite of many obstacles, he was taking the first
steps in that direction. An initial difficulty lay in the mental
aberrations of the King, whose conduct still caused intense
anxiety or annoyance.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> Scarcely a day passed without a lapse
into incoherence or violence. Moreover, his conversation often
showed a lack of discrimination, being the same to the Queen,
the physicians, or the servants. He made the most capricious
changes, turning off the Queen's favourite coachman, and making
grooms footmen, and footmen grooms, to the distraction of the
household. On assuming office, Pitt consulted the royal physicians
and received a reply, dated Queen's Palace, 16th May
1804, stating that the King was equal to the discharge of important
business, but must avoid long conferences or any deviation
from his usual habits, quiet being essential. Thereupon Pitt
and Lord Eldon wrote to the King urging this prudent course.
They frequently visited Buckingham House, where five physicians
were in almost constant attendance, a state of things
viewed with alarm by patriots and with eager hope by the
Foxites and their hangers on.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately George could not compose himself to rest.
Such is the tenor of hasty notes sent to Pitt by Villiers, now
high in favour at Kew and Windsor. They describe the King's
fussy intervention in household affairs, his orders for sudden and
expensive changes in the palaces, his substitution of German for
English servants, his frequent visits to the stables unaccompanied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>by the equerry, his irritability on the most trifling occasions, and,
alternating with this undignified bustle, fits of somnolence which
at times overtook him even on horseback. Then, too, there were
quarrels with the Queen, whose conduct, said Villiers, was such
as to aggravate these troubles and check the course of recovery.
Indeed, the King's violent headaches seemed to Dr. Milman to
presage an attack of apoplexy. At all times he showed a
marked preference for the company of servants and workmen,
declaring the higher officials to be "Court nuisances." Villiers
therefore begged Pitt to request an interview with the King, now
at Kew, for he took no notice of letters. On Midsummer day
Villiers suggested means for assuring the veto of the physicians
on the projected visit to Weymouth, in view of the extravagance
and inconvenience of the plans to which it gave rise.</p>

<p>Among them was the collection of a large military force in
Dorset, George being convinced that the French would land
there rather than in Kent or Essex. Fortunately, the Duke of
York dissuaded him from a step so eminently favourable to
Napoleon; for about this time the King wrote to the Duke:
"As I am no friend to obstinacy, I will agree to lessen the
demand from other districts" (<span lang="la">i.e.</span>, for an "Army of Reserve" in
Dorset). The visit to Weymouth was also postponed; and
Camden, Secretary at War, countermanded the construction of
huge barracks at that town, which the King had ordered without
consulting the Cabinet or the Duke of York. On 1st August
Villiers reported the refusal of the King to see the Prince of
Wales, with whom no complete reconciliation was possible.
George wished Villiers to come and reside near Windsor and
manage all his private affairs, and would take no refusal. But
how, asked Villiers, was he to do this on &pound;330 a year? He therefore
requested the advice and help of Pitt.<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></p>

<p>At Weymouth, late in the summer, the quarrels between the
King and Queen again became acute, as appears from confidential
letters which Lord Hawkesbury wrote to Pitt. The
latter sided with the Queen and Princes on some points; and
indeed through these months the conduct of George seems to
have been so exasperating that the Princesses almost sank
under the ceaseless strain, for Queen Charlotte, too, was "ill and
cross." In vain did Pitt seek to effect a reconciliation between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>the King and the Prince of Wales. The only result of his efforts
was a formal and fruitless interview. Last but not least of Pitt's
Court worries was the conduct of the Princess of Wales. Her
wayward and extravagant habits increased the aversion of the
Prince, and produced scandals so serious that Pitt urgently but
ineffectually remonstrated with her at her residence in Blackheath.
Such were the diversions of a Minister on whom almost
singly rested the burden of defending his country at this crisis.</p>

<p>The eccentricities of the King seriously hampered British
diplomacy. For how could Russia and Austria bind themselves
to an Administration which might at any time be succeeded by
one which was under the domination of the Prince of Wales,
Fox, and Sheridan? True, offers of a defensive alliance were
mooted at St. Petersburg to our ambassador, Admiral Warren.
But it was obvious even to that misplaced sailor, whom Pitt
soon recalled, that Russia merely aimed at securing English
subsidies and help for her garrison at Corfu, now threatened by
Soult. The timid conduct of Francis&nbsp;II, who, as if in imitation
of Napoleon, assumed the title of Hereditary Emperor of
the Austrian Empire, further prescribed caution; and only by
slow degrees did the Czar Alexander feel his way towards an
understanding with England. His jealousy respecting Malta,
and the uncertainties at London and Windsor, held these
natural allies apart for many months. Pitt did not hurry
matters, doubtless from a conviction that the conduct of
Napoleon must before long bring both Russia and Austria into
the field. Meanwhile, he withheld subsidies which would have
helped them to arm for an almost inevitable struggle.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> We need
not therefore trace the course of these coy advances until they
led to definite overtures. Here as always Pitt showed a dignified
reserve and a cautious regard for British finances, which refute
the stories officially circulated at Paris as to his lavishly bribing
the Continental States to attack France. As usually happens,
the prosaic truth long remained hidden in British despatches,
while the piquant slander gained all but universal acceptance.</p>

<p>Pitt's first thought was to enhance the value of England's
friendship by strengthening her navy and enabling her to take
the offensive if an occasion offered. The French royalist refugee,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>General Dumouriez, in a long Memoir which he drew up for the
Cabinet, pointed out that nothing was more perilous than a
perpetual defensive, as it allowed the enemy quietly to perfect
his plans for attack at any point over the whole field.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> Pitt was
well aware of this danger. In fact, his policy of military pinpricks,
while apparently wasteful and inconclusive, had prevented
that concentration of the enemy's force which alone could ensure
the capture of London. Once more, then, he aimed at strengthening
the regular army, reducing the Militia to its usual quota,
and raising a large force of Volunteers. On 5th June 1804 he
brought forward his proposal for repairing the defects of Yorke's
Army of Reserve Act. They arose from the following provisions.
A man, when drawn to serve in that force, must either come
forward, find a substitute, or pay a fine of &pound;20 for each year of
default. A penalty also fell on every parish failing to supply
its quota. The consequence was that parishes and individuals
offered high bounties in order to escape the fine&mdash;sometimes as
much as &pound;40 or &pound;60 per man.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> These bounties naturally drew
the best recruits to the Army of Reserve, to the detriment both
of the army and navy. Another source of loss to the line regiments
was the addition to the strength of the Militia, the net
result being that 9,000 more recruits were required annually for
the regular forces. These therefore suffered from the competition
of the second and third lines of defence; and in this competition
(then unusually severe) has always lain the crux of the
British military problem.</p>

<p>Pitt sought to solve the problem by reducing the Militia (now
74,000 strong) to the old standard of 52,000 men, transferring
the surplus to the Army of Reserve. He also suggested various
inducements to men in the latter force to enter the line regiments.
Further, he proposed to lessen the penalties levied on
defaulters. While maintaining the principle of compulsory service,
at least for a considerable part of the population, he lessened
the inducements which told in favour of the Army of Reserve
and against the Line. Further, in place of the irritating plan of
recruiting by the compulsion of the ballot, Pitt made the parish
authorities responsible for the supply of their quota. If, even so,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>the parishes could not find the men, the commander of the district
was empowered to raise them by the ordinary means of
recruiting. He further proposed to associate in each district the
battalions of the Army of Reserve with those of the Line, in the
well-grounded hope of increasing <span lang="fr">esprit de corps</span> and stimulating
the flow of men into the first line of defence.</p>

<p>The chief critic of these proposals was Sheridan who, on 18th
June brilliantly declaimed against the formation of a great
Regular Army, as alien to the spirit of our people, and by all
the arts of rhetorical necromancy sought to raise the spectre of
a Standing Army. When others bemoaned the threatened increase
of taxation and Windham and Craufurd ("Craufurd of
the Light Division") criticized the measure severely, the Opposition
cherished the hope of defeating the Ministry. The debate
dragged on till 4 a.m. when 265 members supported Pitt against
223 Noes. The Bill became law on 29th June. Undoubtedly it
failed to answer his hopes. Recruits did not come in, probably
because most parishes were thenceforth content to pay the
smaller fines now imposed. Grenville even ventured to assert
that the Regular Army was smaller at the beginning of 1805
than a year earlier. Certainly the numbers were deficient; and
Pitt accordingly on 31st March 1805 brought in a Bill to attract
men from the Supplementary Militia into the Regular Army by
a bounty of ten guineas per man. This brought forward 11,000
men, but at the expense of the Militia.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> Thus Pitt did not solve
the military problem. Who indeed has solved it?</p>

<p>Most fortunately for England, the Emperor had made serious
miscalculations respecting the flotilla now preparing at the ports
between Ostend and Etaples. First he armed his gun-boats
heavily so that they might fight their way across against a fleet.
On finding this to be impossible, he had to face the delay and
expense of reconstruction. Next the harbours at and near
Boulogne proved to be too shallow and too small for the enlarged
flotilla. The strengthening of the French fleet was also a
work of time. England therefore gained a year's respite. Indeed
not a few experienced naval officers scouted an invasion by the
flotilla as impossible. General Moore also believed that Napoleon
would never be so mad as to make the attempt, which
must end in our glory and his disgrace. Only by continuing to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>threaten us could he do harm.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> Another sceptic was Lord
Melville, First Lord of the Admiralty, who, in a letter of 14th
October, urged Pitt during his stay at Weymouth to represent
to the King the importance of attacking the flotilla at Boulogne,
if only in order to show the impracticability of Napoleon's
scheme. Experienced officers, said Melville, reported that the
flotilla must embark the troops in the outer road; yet the
work of getting that vast concourse of boats out of the inner
harbour could not be accomplished in less than four, five, or
perhaps even six tides. We must therefore attack them during
this tedious operation. "Our officers and seamen," he continues,
"have a perfect confidence that they can attack them under
their own batteries, and put them into immediate confusion....
Their confidence is founded on the experiment they have already
made of entering in the night the Bay of Boulogne and sustaining
for many hours the whole fire of the enemy's batteries without
a single man being hurt." Moreover, the British fire-ships,
being like ordinary ships, will take the enemy by surprise and
cause irremediable confusion.<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> Apparently the King and Pitt
thought an attack not only too risky, in view of the failures at
Boulogne in 1801 and on 3rd October 1804, but also needless, if
the flotilla were no more formidable than Melville pronounced.
While inspecting the "Royal Sovereign" at Portsmouth on 6th
October the King wrote to Pitt enjoining great caution, as a
failure would be very discreditable.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<p>I do not propose to discuss here the much debated question
whether Napoleon intended to invade England, or to wear us
out by threats of invasion.<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> Suffice it to say that no responsible
Minister could ignore those formidable preparations. Pitt therefore
strove might and main to raise martial enthusiasm by
attending drills and reviews of Volunteers. A cynical phrase in
Grenville's letter of 25th August 1804 dwells on the ridiculous
figure which he cut, riding from Downing Street to Wimbledon
Common and thence to Cox Heath in Kent "to inspect military
carriages, impregnable batteries, and Lord Chatham's reviews.
Can he possibly be serious in expecting Bonaparte now?" The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>sneer is a sign of the strained relations between the cousins.
Assuredly, if Bonaparte had come, Grenville and his Foxite
allies would have impeached a Minister who left his country
defenceless. Pitt showed a good example to country gentlemen
by drilling his corps of Volunteers at Walmer, so that it became
a model of efficiency. There was the greatest need at that point,
for the coast between Ramsgate and Dungeness presented exceptional
facilities for a landing except under the guns of Sandown,
Deal, Walmer, and Dover. Pitt's attention was specially
directed to the open shelving beach between Folkestone and
Dungeness.</p>

<p>In truth, the district of Romney Marsh, which is not normally
marshy, offered the maximum of attractions to an invader,
who, after beaching his boats and entrenching himself behind
a fosse, would find few, if any, physical obstacles to his advance
into the level tract between Ashford and Tonbridge. As this
route was undefended, Pitt and Camden, by the month of
October 1804, decided on the construction of the Hythe Military
Canal. On 24th October Pitt attended a meeting of the
"surveyors, lords, bailiffs and jurats" of Romney Marsh held
at Dymchurch, Generals Sir David Dundas and Moore, and
Colonel Brown being also present. It was agreed that the proposed
canal from Sandgate to Rye would be beneficial to Romney
Marsh, and landlords were urged forthwith to put their
property at the disposal of Government, trusting to receive compensation
assessed by a duly qualified local jury. On Pitt's
recommendation the matter was passed at once, and he returned
to Walmer Castle.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> By the end of 1804 the work was well in
hand, the expense of cutting the fosse of ten feet deep being
estimated at &pound;150,000. Batteries and martello towers were
designed for its protection especially around Hythe and Dymchurch.
At the latter place were sluices for flooding the marsh.
Criticisms have fallen freely upon Pitt's canal, the report gaining
currency that it was intended for the conveyance of military
stores. Its true purpose was to isolate the most vulnerable part
of the coast and to form a barrier which would at least delay an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>invader until reinforcements arrived. In its original condition it
was an excellent first line of defence of South Kent; and, unless
the French flotilla brought over pontoons, it formed a barrier not
easily penetrable, which fully justified its comparatively small
cost.</p>

<p>The same remarks apply to the martello towers. The responsibility
for them rests mainly with Colonel Twiss and Captain
Ford, who in the summer of 1803 recommended their construction
at exposed points of the shore, at a cost of about &pound;3,000
apiece. The experience of our troops in Corsica showed that
such towers, even when held by small garrisons, could hold at
bay a greatly superior force.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> The towers were begun soon
afterwards; but those in Pevensey Bay were not undertaken till
1805&ndash;6. The first points to be defended were those nearest to
France.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1804&ndash;5 there was need to strengthen the
coast defences; for the declaration of war by Spain placed the
whole of the coast line from the Texel to Toulon at Napoleon's
disposal for shipbuilding. There seemed therefore every
prospect of our being finally overwhelmed at sea, a consummation
which the French Emperor might have ensured had he refrained
from irritating the monarchs of Russia and Austria.
Fortunately for England, his nature was too restless and domineering
to admit of the necessary concentration of effort on the
naval problem; and that besetting sin, megalomania, marred
prospects which then seemed easily realizable. Playing with
coolness and patience, he had the game in his hands in 1804,
when as yet there was little prospect of an Anglo-Russian
alliance.</p>

<p>An offensive alliance of Spain with France was the natural
result of the treaty of 1796 between the two Powers. In vain
did the luxurious Charles&nbsp;IV and his pampered minion, Godoy,
Prince of the Peace, seek to evade their obligations. Under
threat of a French invasion they gave way and agreed to pay
72,000,000 francs a year into the French exchequer, and to
force the hand of Portugal. That little Power purchased immunity
for a time by paying an annual subsidy of 12,000,000
francs to France. Spain also repaired French warships which
took refuge at Ferrol in July 1804, and allowed reinforcements
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>to their crews to travel thither overland. When Pitt and Harrowby
remonstrated on this conduct, Spain armed as if for war;
and in answer to inquiries from London, Godoy alleged certain
disputes with the United States as the cause of his alarm. The
arrival in London of Frere, our ambassador at Madrid, on 17th
September 1804 revealed the unreality of this excuse; for he
reported that Spain had previously decided to yield on that
question. As the Spanish fleet was evidently preparing to cooperate
with that of Napoleon, Pitt resolved to deal the blow
which Chatham was not allowed to deliver in 1761. The weak
point of Spain was her treasure fleet; there was an inner fitness
in wrenching from her the gold which was soon to go into
Napoleon's coffers.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, 18th September, the Cabinet assembled, Eldon,
Camden, Hawkesbury, Melville, Mulgrave, and Pitt being
present. In view of the news brought by Frere, and other tidings
from Rear-Admiral Cochrane off Ferrol, Ministers decided to
order Cochrane closely to blockade that port, preventing both
French and Spanish ships from sailing out. Admiral Cornwallis,
then blockading Brest, was to reinforce Cochrane, thereby assuring
the capture of the Spanish treasure ships bound from South
America to Cadiz.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> Pitt at once reported this decision to Harrowby,
then in attendance on the King at Weymouth, and urged
a speedy ratification of it.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> Hence without delay the order went
forth which enlarged the area of strife. The four frigates despatched
for the seizure of the treasure-ships were not so
superior in force to the convoying corvettes as to avert a conflict.
One of the Spanish ships blew up: the others surrendered
(5th October 1804). Resenting this outrage, Spain declared war
on 12th December.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> Pitt did not consider the capture of the
treasure-ships as necessarily involving war, but rather as a sharp
warning, called for by the hostile conduct of Spain; for on 23rd
September he wrote to Harrowby stating that they must wait
for the Spanish answer to our ultimatum, and in the meantime
Spanish merchantmen might leave British ports unmolested.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></p>

<p>The seizure of the Spanish treasure-ships caused resentment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>at St. Petersburg until the causes of Britain's action were more
fully known. But the event did not long delay a good understanding.
The prospect of Sicily falling a prey to the French
army of occupation in South Italy alarmed both the Czar
Alexander and Pitt. The former was bound by a Convention
signed in 1798 to befriend the Neapolitan Court; and it was
also to his interest to prevent France dominating the Mediterranean
and expelling the Russians from Corfu. He therefore
demanded from Napoleon the evacuation of Italy and North
Germany, a suitable compensation for the King of Sardinia for
the loss of his mainland possessions, and the recognition of the
complete neutrality of the Germanic Empire. Far from complying
with these demands, Napoleon kept his troops in South
Italy and Hanover, and early in November seized Sir Horace
Rumbold, British ambassador at Hamburg. At once Pitt and
Harrowby made effective use of this incident to prove the impossibility
of peace with Napoleon. The Russian and Prussian
Courts sent sharp remonstrances to Paris; and, to humour
Frederick William, Napoleon ordered the release of the envoy,
though in the most grudging way possible. This violation of international
law served to counterbalance our irregular action
against Spain.</p>

<p>In short, Napoleon's evident resolve everywhere to carry
matters with a high hand convinced the Czar that war was inevitable;
and he prepared to espouse the cause of Britain, not so
much from sympathy with her as from detestation of her restless
adversary.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> On 20th November Pitt wrote from Downing Street
to Harrowby, who was then taking the waters at Bath, expressing
joy that the views of Russia coincided entirely with ours,
especially as to the reduction of the French Power within its
ancient limits. He added these noteworthy words: "The restoration
of the [French] monarchy may become in the course of
events an object to be distinctly aimed at, but it certainly cannot
be made a substantive object in the first instance; and it is
very satisfactory to see that in this important point there is no
apparent difference in our sentiments."<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> The hope of ending
Prussia's subservience to Napoleon, and of inspiring Francis of
Austria with a manly resolve, proved futile. Frederick William
and Haugwitz hoped to creep into Hanover, under the French
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>Emperor's cloak, and Austria had not yet suffered enough
humiliation to lead her to fling down the gauntlet. True, she
signed a compact with Russia on 6th November 1804; but it
was timidly defensive in tone. Alexander therefore held back in
the hope that events would compel her to take sides against
Napoleon.</p>

<p>Far less calculating was Gustavus&nbsp;IV of Sweden. With the
chivalrous zeal of his race he stood forth the first among the
European monarchs as the declared ally of England. After the
execution of the Duc d'Enghien by the French Emperor, he informed
"Monsieur" Napoleon Bonaparte of the rupture of all
relations between them; and now, on 3rd December 1804, an
Anglo-Swedish Convention was signed, placing at our disposal
the Isle of R&uuml;gen and the fortress of Stralsund in Swedish
Pomerania, in return for a subsidy of &pound;80,000. This sum served
but to whet his appetite for subsidies, his demands almost
equalling in extravagance his Quixotic summons to a royalist
crusade.</p>

<p>Pitt therefore based his hopes on the statesmanlike policy of
the Czar, who in that month despatched to London one of his
confidants, a clever but viewy young man, of frank and engaging
manners, Count Novossiltzoff. Ostensibly the mission was for
scientific purposes; but French agents discovered that he took
with him a plan of a Coalition against Napoleon.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> This seems
to have led the Emperor to take a step similar to that of
Christmastide 1799. On 2nd January 1805 he wrote a letter
direct to George&nbsp;III, proposing terms of peace. The King at
once expressed to Pitt his astonishment that "the French
usurper" had addressed him in this objectionable manner, and
highly approved the draft of an answer which Pitt had thoughtfully
forwarded to Windsor. In it Pitt declared that His Majesty
could not enter upon the proposed overtures for peace until he
had communicated them to the Powers with which he had confidential
ties, especially to the Emperor of Russia. At the
King's command, he sent a copy of this answer to St. Petersburg.
At London, then, as also at Paris, Napoleon's offer was
deemed a diplomatic device for getting news, though it also
enabled him to represent himself as the friend of peace and Pitt
as its worst enemy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span></p>
<p>While the French Emperor played his game with the advantages
conferred by a daring initiative, superior force, and unquestioned
authority at home, Pitt had to employ all possible
means to conciliate allies abroad and half-hearted friends at
Westminster. His position was far from secure. True, the King
had now recovered almost his usual health; but in Parliament
the Ministry with difficulty repelled the bitter attacks of Fox,
Sheridan, Grenville, and Windham. The speech of Grenville
on the seizure of the Spanish treasure ships was of singular
bitterness. Though aware of the provocations of the Spanish
Court, he chose to represent that affair as a cowardly, and
almost piratical attack on an unprepared Power. Pitt had expected
some such misrepresentations. He knew that the Opposition
would strain every nerve to overthrow him; and in the
Christmas Vacation he made timely overtures through Hawkesbury
for the support of Addington. The two old friends met on
23rd December 1804, at Hawkesbury's residence, Coombe Wood,
near Richmond Park. The host contrived to be absent when
Pitt entered the room, and he advanced with the cordial greeting:
"I rejoice to take you by the hand again."</p>

<p>Converse of three hours ensued between them alone. Addington
demurred to Pitt's request that he should retire to the Upper
House. Finally, however, he agreed to do so, accepting the
title of Viscount Sidmouth, taking also the Presidency of the
Council, which the Duke of Portland, for reasons of health,
wished to relinquish, though he finally agreed to remain in the
Cabinet without office. Lord Hobart, now Earl of Buckinghamshire,
also entered the Cabinet as Chancellor of the Duchy
of Lancaster in place of Lord Mulgrave, who now succeeded
Lord Harrowby at the Foreign Office. Pitt further promised
to promote some of Addington's supporters, including his
brother-in-law, Bragge Bathurst.</p>

<p>These changes were resented by several of Pitt's supporters,
especially by Rose. We have already noticed his contempt for
Addington's financial shifts; and he now, on 8th January 1805,
wrote to Bishop Tomline deploring Pitt's junction with "a man
whose imbecility and falsehood, under Mr. Pitt's own sanction,"
had weakened the country. Pitt would now gain a few votes,
no additional talents, and an increase of rancour in the Opposition.
"We shall," adds Rose, "drag on a wretched existence
and expire not creditably. What next will happen God only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
knows."<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> Canning was equally annoyed at the new Coalition.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>
His sharp tongue and still sharper pen had deeply annoyed
Addington. Who, indeed, would not have resented this reference
in the "Apothecary's Hall (First of April)":</p>


<p class="poem">
When his speeches hobble vilely<br />
How "Hear him" bursts from brother Hiley!<br />
When his faltering periods lag<br />
Hark to the cheers of brother Bragge!<br />
</p>


<p>Sarcasms on Hawkesbury had also annoyed that susceptible
Minister; so that in June 1804 Canning offered to resign his
Treasurership of the Navy. The matter was patched up, only
to be opened once more in the winter. Pitt sought to mediate
between the bard and his victim, but failed to elicit from
Canning an apology as complete as Hawkesbury demanded.
Finally, on 18th January, Canning informed Pitt that, as Hawkesbury
had left his letter unanswered for three days, he declined
to take the further steps which Pitt recommended.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> Is it surprising
that the health of the Prime Minister began to suffer?
Friends noted with concern his thinness and a hacking cough.
Nevertheless, he rode out successfully the squalls of the session
of 1805, beating off the onset of Sheridan against his Defence
Bill, and defeating an inopportune motion of Fox for Catholic
Emancipation.</p>

<p>On this subject Pitt secretly sympathized with Fox, but his
hands were tied both by his promise of March 1801 to the King
not to bring up the subject during his reign, and recently by his
union with Addington. The Irish Catholics knew of these difficulties;
and at meetings held by their leading men at the house
of James Ryan, a wealthy Dublin merchant, in the autumn of
1804, both Lord Fingall and Counsellor Scully deprecated a
petition to Parliament as alike useless and embarrassing. Scully
urged that they must conciliate one whose "opinions had literally
proved of great weight in the Catholic cause.... The Catholics
owe him [Pitt] respect for his enlarged and manly conceptions
of the necessity of relieving them, and the dignified energy with
which he publicly expressed those conceptions." A Committee
was chosen to consider the matter and communicate with Pitt.
It included Fingall, Sir Thomas French, Scully, and others. At
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>the third meeting at Ryan's house, on 17th November, Keogh
sharply blamed Fingall for opposing the petition, and commented
adversely on the silence of Pitt. Scully inferred from it
"that he is favourably disposed, but in some way, to them unknown,
not in a situation in which he can freely act," or even
explain his reticence; but no Catholic wished to embarrass him.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>
Nevertheless, the petition was resolved on; and it is clear that
Fox encouraged the petitioners rather from the hope of embarrassing
Pitt than of carrying Catholic Emancipation.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p>

<p>In March 1805 Scully came to London, and saw Fox, Nepean,
and Grey. Pitt received him and others of the Irish deputation
at Downing Street on the 12th. Scully noted in his diary: "He
[Pitt] wore dirty boots and odd-fashioned, lank leather breeches,
but otherwise well dressed and cleanly, his hair powdered, etc.
He was very courteous and cordial in words and looks, but his
carriage was stiff and strait, perhaps naturally so. His face cold
and harsh, rather selfish, but acute and sensible. We took our
seats after much reciprocal ceremony." Pitt declined Fingall's
request that he should present the Catholic petition, though he
admitted that the measure would be most salutary whenever the
proper time would arrive; but he added with a smile that he
could not tell when that would be. The deputation failed to
move him from this position, and thereafter committed its cause
to the Opposition.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> Despite excellent speeches by Fox and
Grey, and by Grenville and Holland in the Lords, the motions
for Catholic Emancipation were rejected by large majorities.
The speech of Pitt on 14th May, to which reference has already
been made, naturally lacked energy and fire; he opposed Fox's
motion solely on the ground of present expediency.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a></p>

<p>The worst trial of the session was the impeachment of his old
friend, Lord Melville. As Treasurer of the Navy in Pitt's former
Administration, he had been guilty of a serious irregularity in
not preventing Deputy Treasurer Trotter from using the sum of
&pound;10,000 for private speculation. Suspicions having been aroused
on this and other grounds, a Commission was appointed to sift
the matter to the bottom. The tenth Report dealing with these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>charges came out on 17th or 18th March; and Wilberforce, who
then chanced to be with Pitt, noted how eagerly, without waiting
to cut open the pages, he sought to tear out the secret.
It proved to be highly unfavourable to Melville. In vain did
Wilberforce and Bankes seek to persuade Pitt to adopt a judicial
attitude on this question. Though his friendship with Melville
had cooled, yet it was still strong, and he finally agreed with
Lord Sidmouth to press for a committee of inquiry. Only so
could he count on the support of the Addingtonians. On 8th
April, then, he resolutely defended Melville against the aspersions
of Whitbread, maintaining that the evidence before the
Commission was far from conclusive, and moving that a select
Committee of the House should make further investigations.</p>

<p>The debate was long and stormy. Petty, Tierney, George
Ponsonby, and Fox censured Melville severely. Canning with his
wonted brilliance, Castlereagh with the usual laboured infelicity,
sought to strengthen the defence; but it had almost collapsed
when, about 4 a.m. of 9th April, Wilberforce arose. At once
Pitt bent forward and sent an eager glance down the Treasury
bench at his old friend; for the verdict of a conscientious and
independent member at such a time is decisive. Speaking with
the calm of deep conviction, the member for Yorkshire declared
against Melville, whereupon Pitt sank back with signs of
deep pain. The division showed 216 for and 216 against the
motion of censure. The Speaker, Abbott, turned deathly white,
and after a long and trying pause gave the casting vote against
the Government. Then the pent up feelings burst forth. The
groups of the Opposition united in yells of triumph; one member
gave the "view holloa," and others shouted to Pitt to resign.
He meanwhile pressed forward his hat to hide the tears which
stole down his cheeks. Fitzharris, son of Lord Malmesbury,
and a few devoted friends formed a phalanx to screen him from
the insolent stare of Colonel Wardle and others who were
crowding round the exit to see "how Billy Pitt looked after
it"; and he was helped out of the House in a half unconscious
state. The blow told severely on a frame already enfeebled by
overwork and worry.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<p>Whitbread's further motion for impeachment was rejected
(11th June), but a similar motion succeeded a fortnight later.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>Public opinion, however, soon began to veer round and pronounce
the conduct of the Opposition rancorous. Melville's relative,
Sir Charles Middleton, in a letter to Wilberforce, denounced it
as sheer persecution, seeing that the nation had suffered no loss,
and Melville had served it many years with indefatigable zeal. As
for Melville, he retired to his Highland seat, "Dunira," and in the
last letter which he wrote to Pitt, dated 11th November 1805,
expressed gratitude for Pitt's recent message that his energy at
the Admiralty had largely contributed to the triumph at Trafalgar.
Melville's feelings further appeared in the postscript,
that Nelson's death was "enviable beyond expression," as placing
"his fair fame beyond the reach of caprice, envy, or malevolence."<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>
Pitt did not live on to see the vindication of his old
friend. On 12th June 1806, after a trial of twelve days in Westminster
Hall, the Peers acquitted Melville on all the ten counts,
the prosecution failing to prove that he had benefited by Trotter's
irregular use of the sum of &pound;10,000. It is worth noting that
Whitbread in his final attack declared his belief that Pitt in
similar circumstances would have died rather than connive at
such an irregularity.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> This statement may be set against the
Bacchic outburst of Creevey, after the hostile vote in Parliament,
that Pitt had betrayed Melville in order to save himself from
ruin.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p>Pitt, seconded in this by Grenville, urged the appointment of
Middleton, whose sagacity and long experience at the Admiralty
had of late furnished the First Lord with invaluable counsel.
True, he was eighty years of age, but neither had his frame lost
vigour nor his mind alertness. Seeing that his reputation as a
naval expert was unequalled, Pitt little expected to encounter
the stiff opposition of Lords Sidmouth and Buckinghamshire to
the appointment, which they designed for Buckinghamshire,
Hawkesbury, or Charles Yorke. The King, too, probably influenced
by Sidmouth, expressed his disapproval of Middleton,
preferring those just named, or Castlereagh, or even Chatham.
In a matter which concerned the safety of the nation Pitt was
inexorable, facing for several days the threats of resignation of
his two colleagues and the disapproval of the King. Finally he
carried his point, the two lords being pacified by the assurance
that Middleton's appointment would be temporary. The King
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>also consented to raise him to the peerage as Lord Barham,
adding, however, the proviso that he should attend the Cabinet
only during the discussion of naval affairs. In this grudging
way did the Monarch and Sidmouth permit Middleton to reap
the reward of life-long service and the nation to benefit by his
unique experience. Only of late has the work done by Barham
during the Trafalgar campaign been duly set forth; and it is
therefore possible now to estimate the service rendered by Pitt
in insisting on his appointment even at the risk of the secession
of the Addingtonian group.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></p>

<p>Before referring to naval affairs, we must glance at the efforts
of Pitt to frame a Coalition of the Powers against France. In the
middle of January 1805 he had important interviews with Novossiltzoff,
the envoy whom the Czar Alexander had despatched
to London on an important mission. For this ardent young
reformer Alexander had drawn up secret instructions which the
curious may read in the Memoirs of his Minister, Czartoryski.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>
They illustrate the mingling of sentimentality and statecraft, of
viewiness and ambition, which accounts for the strange oscillations
of Muscovite policy between altruistic philosophy and
brutal self-seeking. At present the Russian Janus turned his
modern face westwards. Alexander insisted on the need of
tearing from France the mask of liberty which she had so long
and so profitably worn. Against the naturalism of Rousseau,
which supplied Napoleon with excellent reasons for every annexation,
Alexander resolved to appeal to historical rights and
the Balance of Power. Yet he also resolved to uphold the
rights of all the peoples concerned. They must be reconciled
to their rulers so as to harmonize the claims of legitimacy and
liberty. Thus, the King of Sardinia, when restored to his throne
at Turin, was to be induced to grant a Constitution. The Germanic
System was to be rescued from chaos by the grant of
free federal institutions. The independence of the Italian, Helvetic,
and Dutch Republics was a matter of urgency, those
States being also strengthened against French aggressions.
Finally, Russia and England were, if possible, to secure the
friendship of Turkey.</p>

<p>With these aims Pitt declared his entire concurrence, a just
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>and lasting peace being the first of British interests. He developed
these notions in a remarkable document of date 19th
January 1805. We may be sure that it is his; for, an accident
having befallen the Earl of Harrowby at the close of 1804, Lord
Mulgrave took his place at the Foreign Office, and a new comer
would not have ventured to impose his own views as to the
future of Europe. Pitt now recurred to his plans of the year
1798 for assuring the repose of the Continent. In brief, they
were the aggrandisement of Austria in Northern Italy and of
Prussia in the Low Countries so as to form barriers against
France. The Italian Republic must therefore be divided between
the Hapsburgs and the King of Sardinia, the latter also absorbing
the Genoese Republic, which had forfeited all claim to consideration.
Pitt did not enter into details respecting Belgium;
but probably he intended to offer it to Prussia, in order to still
her cravings for Hanover. Such was his proposal to the Court
of Berlin in October 1805.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> Conscious, perhaps, that the present
plans were not consonant with the benevolent idealism of Russian
policy, which, however, stole sidelong glances at Constantinople,
Pitt declared that only by these arrangements could the
peace of Europe be secured. They were therefore "not repugnant
to the most sacred principles of justice and public
morality." In order further to curb the aggressions of Napoleon,
the Great Powers were mutually to guarantee their possessions,
thus laying the foundation of a system of public right.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p>

<p>This scheme clearly foreshadows the system of alliances and
compromises carried out by Castlereagh in the Treaty of Chaumont
nine years later. Pitt also assented to the Czar's proposal
that the final settlement should be guaranteed by international
agreements forming a basis for the new European polity, a suggestion
in which lies the germ of the Holy Alliance. It would
be absurd to hold Pitt responsible for the strange and unforeseen
developments of the years 1815&ndash;25. But it is to be regretted
that fear of Napoleon should have obliterated his earlier aim of
forming a defensive league of the weaker States. His cure for
the evils of French domination was scarcely better than the evils
themselves. The installation of the Hapsburgs at Venice and
Milan, of Victor Emmanuel&nbsp;I at Genoa, of Frederick William of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>Prussia at Brussels, could not permanently improve the lot of
the Italian and Belgian peoples. So soon as we formulate the
question we see that, as in 1798, Pitt left their welfare out of
count. He aimed merely at piling up barriers against France,
and trusted to some vague arrangement with the Czar for safeguarding
the political rights of the bartered peoples.</p>

<p>Pitt's reliance on the statics of statecraft rather than on the
dynamics of nationality tells against the credibility of the oft-repeated
story that he prophesied the liberation of Europe by
the enthusiasm and efforts of the Spaniards. Wellington afterwards
told the Spanish general, Alava, that Pitt, on hearing of
the disaster of Ulm, made this prophecy at a dinner party at
which he (then Sir Arthur Wellesley) was present. Difficulties of
time and place militate against the anecdote, which, moreover, is
out of harmony with the sentiments expressed in Pitt's speeches,
letters, and despatches.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> Further, his experience of Spain was
such as to inspire him with deep distrust; and, finally, the cast
of his mind was so far objective as to forbid the indulgence of
speculations on the little-known topic of nationality. Distrusting
novel theories, he sought to utilize forces of tried potency. He
worked by diplomatic methods through Governments, not through
the tumultuary efforts of peoples. Dependence on a nation so
backward as the Spaniards would have seemed to him madness.
Even if he could have seen the surprising events of May&ndash;June
1808, he would probably have distrusted the spirit which
prompted them. In truth, he lacked the sympathetic instinct
which led Canning at that crisis to side with the Spanish patriots
and thus open a new chapter in the history of Europe.</p>

<p>Yet it is but just to remember that Pitt the diplomatic bargainer
of 1805 differed from Pitt the upholder of weak States
in 1790, only because the times had completely changed. Against
the destructive schemes of Joseph&nbsp;II, Catharine&nbsp;II, and Hertzberg
he worked on the whole successfully. But now Poland was
gone; Sweden and Turkey were safe; the German tangle had
been cut by the Secularizations of Church domains in 1803.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>Now the danger was from the West. France had swallowed
up her weaker neighbours. Napoleon dominated Spain, Italy,
Switzerland, the Rhenish States, and the Netherlands. Russian
policy, subversive under Catharine, was in a European sense
conservative under Alexander. Then the most damaging thrusts
to the European fabric came from Vienna and St. Petersburg.
Now they came from Paris. Pitt therefore sought to construct a
rampart out of the weak States bordering on France. As the
Barrier Treaties of a century earlier were directed against
Louis&nbsp;XIV, so now Pitt sought to inaugurate an enlarged
Barrier policy as a safeguard against Napoleon. The efforts of
at least half a million of trained troops being available, the time
had apparently come for a final effort to preserve the Balance of
Power before it was irretrievably impaired.</p>

<p>For a time the Russian and British Governments seemed in
complete accord. Novossiltzoff, on his return to St. Petersburg,
wrote to Pitt on 20th March 1805 (N.S.), describing the entire
concurrence of his master with the principles on which they had
agreed at London. In about eight days he would leave for
Berlin to put forth his utmost endeavours to gain the alliance
of that Court. He would then proceed to Paris to present the
Czar's ultimatum. A refusal was expected; but his master believed
it more dignified to take all reasonable means of ensuring
peace. The orders for mobilizing the Russian troops would go
forth at the time of his departure for Berlin. Before his arrival
at Paris, he hoped to receive from London full powers authorizing
him to speak for Great Britain as well as for Russia.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>

<p>All this implied the closest union and sympathy. But now
Alexander showed the other side of his nature. He sought to
drive a hard bargain with Pitt. Firstly, he strove to obtain the
promise of a larger British force to form an integral part of a
Russian expedition for the deliverance of the Kingdom of Naples.
In view of the paucity of our disposable forces, Pitt had sought to
limit the sphere of action to Sicily and the neighbouring parts
of Calabria, the defence of Sicily, the key of the Mediterranean
and the outwork of Egypt, being now and throughout the war
one of the cardinal aims of British policy. An expedition
under General Sir James Craig was about to set sail for Malta
and Messina; and the Czar required that, when strengthened, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>should act in any part of South Italy, under a Russian general.
After wearisome correspondence, a compromise was arrived at;
and on 19th April 1805 Craig set sail from Portsmouth on his
perilous voyage over seas now and again swept by French and
Spanish warships. By good fortune he escaped these many
dangers, and reached Malta, there setting free seasoned troops
for operations in South Italy. The hardihood of Pitt in sending
forth this expedition has often provoked criticism. But it was
worth while to run serious risks to save Sicily from the grip of
Napoleon, and to wrest from him the initiative which he had
hitherto enjoyed unchallenged. Besides, the Czar insisted on
that effort, and made it almost a <span lang="la">sine qu&acirc; non</span> of his alliance.
In a military sense the results were contemptible; in the diplomatic
sphere they were very great.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a></p>

<p>Twelve days before Craig set sail, Czartoryski worried or
coaxed the British ambassador at St. Petersburg, Lord Granville
Leveson-Gower, into signing a provisional treaty of
alliance. The Czar now promised to set in motion half a million
of men (half of them being Austrians, and only 115,000 Russians)
so as to drive the French from Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and
the Low Countries, England subsidizing the allied forces at the
rate of &pound;1,250,000 a year for every 100,000 men actually employed.
The liberated lands were to have the right of building
their own fortresses and choosing their own constitutions. But
firstly, Alexander would seek to restore peace to Europe; and
to this end he would consent to Napoleon placing his brother
Joseph on the throne of North Italy, either in Piedmont or in
the Italian Republic, shadowy realms being outlined in the
Peninsula for the consolation of the dispossessed King of Sardinia.
But the sting of the proposal was in its tail. Alexander
suggested that, to secure the boon of peace, England should
restore her maritime conquests in the war, and also Malta if
Napoleon insisted on this last, the island being then garrisoned
by Russians. In its blend of hazy theorizings on general topics
with astute egotism in Russian affairs, the scheme is highly
characteristic, peace being assured by means which would substitute
Muscovite for British rule at Malta; while in the event
of war, Great Britain was to pay at the rate of &pound;6,250,000 a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>year for campaigns that would aggrandise the continental States
at the expense of France.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></p>

<p>What must have been the feelings of Pitt when he perused
this Byzantine offer? While prepared to give way on some
parts of the January proposals, he was determined to hold fast
to Malta. The island had not been named by him and Novossiltzoff,
its present destiny being assumed as irrevocably fixed.
But now Alexander swung back to the aims of his father, the
domination of the Central Mediterranean from the impregnable
fortress of Valetta. Probably some of the Knights of the Order
of St. John who had sought refuge in Russia gained the ear of
Alexander in the spring of 1805, and produced the startling
change in his policy just described. Whatever the cause, Pitt's
answer could be none other than a firm refusal. In Count
Simon Vorontzoff, Russian ambassador at London, he found a
secret sympathizer, who entered heartily into his plans for the
salvation of Europe, foreseeing that only by the retention of
Malta for the Union Jack could the Mediterranean be saved
from becoming a French lake; and that if either Gower or Pitt
wavered on this question, the country would disown them.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>
Official etiquette, of course, compelled him to proffer Alexander's
demand, and to declare that, unless Pitt gave way about Malta,
there was an end of all hope of the alliance. Here Pitt intervened
with the statesmanlike remark: "It will not save Europe.
The Mediterranean, the Levant and Egypt, will be in the power
of France the moment a British squadron ceases to have for
base a good port protected by formidable fortifications.... So,
whatever pain it causes us (and it is indeed great) we must give
up the hope of seeing the alliance ratified, since its express condition
is our renunciation of Malta. We will continue the war
alone. It will be maritime."</p>

<p>Thus Malta, the final cause of the Great War, now promised to
limit that war. Vorontzoff prevailed on Pitt to defer reporting
his refusal to St. Petersburg. But on 27th May he stated that
the last ray of hope had disappeared, as neither Court would
give way. On 5th June, then, Mulgrave penned for Gower a
despatch summarizing Pitt's reasons why England must retain
Malta. She was ready to restore her valuable conquests in the
East and West Indies, but the key of the Mediterranean she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>must not and would not surrender. Neither would she relax her
maritime code as the Emperor of Russia now insisted; for experience
had shown it to be necessary for the equipment of the
British fleets and the crippling of the enemy's naval construction.
In the maintenance of these fleets lay the only hope of assuring
the salvation of Europe. A more convincing exposition of the
importance of Sea Power has never gone forth from a Government
office.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p>

<p>The deadlock was therefore complete. But now, as happened
more than once in the development of the Coalitions, Napoleon
himself came to the rescue. Whether he was aware of the
breakdown of the Anglo-Russian negotiation is uncertain; but
his remark to Fouch&eacute;&mdash;"I shall be able to strike the blow
before the old Coalition machines are ready"&mdash;and his conduct
in Italy in the months of May and June 1805 bear the imprint of
a boundless confidence, which, on any other supposition, savours
of madness. He well knew that no continental ruler but
Gustavus of Sweden desired war with him. Austria maintained
her timid reserve. Alexander was ready to negotiate with him
through the medium of Novossiltzoff, who was now at Berlin
awaiting permission to proceed to Paris. The predilections of
Frederick William of Prussia for France were notorious; for
Hanover was his goal; and he and his <span class="ins" title="counsellers">counsellors</span> saw far more
hope of securing it from Napoleon than from King George.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>

<p>Prudence and patience were therefore peculiarly necessary
for Napoleon at this juncture. He had the game in his
hands if he would but concentrate all his energies against England
and leave severely alone the land which then most interested
Russia and Austria, namely, Italy. But, either from the
ingrained restlessness of his nature, which chafed at the stalemate
at Boulogne, or from contempt of "the old Coalition
machines," or from an innate conviction that Italy was his own
political preserve, he now took two steps which aroused the
anger of the Russian and Austrian Emperors. On 26th May
1805 he crowned himself King of Italy in the cathedral of
Milan, thereby welding that populous realm indissolubly to his
Empire. On 4th June he annexed outright the Genoese or
Ligurian Republic. Both acts were flagrant infractions of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>Treaty of Lun&eacute;ville with Austria of four years before; and they
contemptuously overturned the Balance of Power which Alexander
was striving to re-establish. The results were soon apparent.
"This man is insatiable," exclaimed Alexander; "his
ambition knows no bounds; he is a scourge of the world: he
wants war; well, he shall have it, and the sooner the better."</p>

<p>Novossiltzoff left Berlin for St. Petersburg; and his despatches
of 10th July to Vorontzoff and to Hardenberg, Foreign Minister
at Berlin, prove conclusively that it was Napoleon's annexation
of Genoa which ended all hope of peace on the Continent.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> The
French Emperor himself admitted as much a few years later
when he visited Genoa. Looking down on that beautiful city,
he exclaimed: "Ah! It was worth a war." In order to work
French patriotism up to the necessary pitch he on 30th May
1805 ordered Fouch&eacute; to have caricatures made at Paris depicting
John Bull, purse in hand, entreating the Powers to take his
money and fight France. Insults to Russia and England make
up the rest of that angry and almost illegible scrawl.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> In his
heart he knew that the war sprang from his resolve to make the
Mediterranean a French lake and Italy an annexe of his imperial
fabric.</p>

<p>The sequel may be told very briefly. On 28th July the Court
of St. Petersburg agreed to Pitt's version of the Anglo-Russian
compact; and on 9th August the British ambassador at St.
Petersburg pledged his country to join the two Empires if
Napoleon rejected the conditions of peace still left open to him.
In that case Gower promised to assure the advance of five
months' subsidy at the rate mentioned above.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> It is needless to
say that Napoleon rejected all thought of compromise; and
Austria began to hurry her troops up the banks of the Danube
for the Bavarian campaign.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> Thus Pitt won the diplomatic game.
Or rather, his opponent gave it to him by the last reckless
move at Genoa. The wrath of Alexander at this affront obliterated
his annoyance at the retention of Malta by Great Britain;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>and both he and the Emperor Francis now prepared to enter
the lists against Napoleon.</p>

<hr />

<p>Meanwhile, Pitt sought to strengthen his Ministry in view
of the desertion of the Addingtonians. Two of them, Hiley
Addington and Bond, spoke bitterly against Melville during the
debates of June, which led Gillray to represent them as jackasses
about to kick a wounded lion. So annoyed was Pitt as to refuse
them promotions which they expected, whereupon Sidmouth
and Buckinghamshire tendered their resignations. The old
friends parted sorrowfully after a final interview at Pitt's house
on Putney Heath (7th July). Camden now became President of
the Council, and Castlereagh Minister at War, Harrowby re-entering
the Cabinet as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.</p>

<p>As the prospect of further taxation was calculated to depress
Pitt's supporters and inspirit the Opposition, he proceeded to
Weymouth in the middle of September to lay before the King
an important proposal. The formation of a truly national Administration
being more than ever essential, he besought George
to admit certain members of the parties of Fox and Grenville,
especially in order to facilitate the passing of the next Budget.
The Monarch, however, was obdurate, asserting that Pitt had
done well in the past session and would probably fare better still
in the next. On 22nd September he repeated these statements
to Rose, whom he called to him on the esplanade, and was quite
unconvinced by his arguments that in the present state of parties
the Budget could scarcely be passed, and that, if Pitt chanced to
be laid up with a fit of gout for two or three weeks, there would
be an end of the Administration. The King would not hear of
any change, and proved more intractable on this topic than in
the year before, during his stay at Cuffnells.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> In fact, in Rose's
manuscript is a statement, prudently omitted from the published
Diaries, that George, on returning to his residence at Weymouth,
declared his resolve rather to risk a civil war than to admit Fox
into his councils.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> Thus ended Pitt's last effort to form a national
Administration fitted to cope with the gigantic power of Napoleon.</p>

<p>It is difficult to realize the multiplicity of the cares which
pressed upon Pitt. Rose feared that he would soon succumb to
the burden; for, apart from the defence of a weak Government
against a strong Opposition, Pitt transacted very much of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>business of the War Office and Foreign Office, besides assisting
the Admiralty and the Commander-in-Chief. No one in Europe,
with the exception of Napoleon, worked so hard; and Pitt,
besides being ten years older than the Emperor, had far less
physical strength. We may judge, then, of the effect produced
by a life such as Lady Hester Stanhope described in a passage
of more than usual credibility: "Ah doctor," she said in her
Lebanon days, "what a life was his! Roused from sleep (for he
was a good sleeper) with a despatch from Lord Melville; then
down to Windsor; then, if he had half an hour to spare, trying
to swallow something; Mr. Adams with a paper, Mr. Long with
another; then Mr. Rose: then, with a little bottle of cordial
confection in his pocket, off to the House until three or four in
the morning; then home to a hot supper for two or three hours
more, to talk over what was to be done next day:&mdash;and wine,
and wine. Scarcely up next morning, when 'tat-tat-tat,' twenty
or thirty people one after another, and the horses walking before
the door from two till sunset, waiting for him. It was enough
to kill a man&mdash;it was murder."<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<p>One who knew Pitt well gave wise advice to his secretary, William
Dacre Adams. "Attend to your meals regularly even if you
sit up or rise the earlier for it to get through the business. I have
often been told that half Mr. Pitt's complaints were originally
brought on by fasting too long and indeed only eating when he
found it convenient, which ruined the tone of his stomach."<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> These
statements explain the reason for the collapse of Pitt's strength late
in the year. Hester's concluding remark is somewhat hysterical,
but it is nearer the truth than the charge that Pitt was greedy of
power. He killed himself by persistent overwork on behalf of a
nation which did not understand him, and in the service of a Monarch
who refused to allow him to strengthen his Administration.</p>

<p>It is impossible now to feel one's way along all the threads
which Pitt held in his hands. But occasionally a chance reference
reveals his connection with designs of vast moment. The
following is a case in point. Castlereagh wrote to him, probably
on 20th August 1805, in terms which show that Pitt took a
leading part in one of the decisions bearing on the fate of the
naval campaign which culminated at Trafalgar. The daring
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>and wisdom of his naval policy in 1805 has lately been fully
vindicated.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> But the following letter throws new light on the
complex problem which arose after the indecisive success gained
by Admiral Calder over Villeneuve's French and Spanish fleets
off Cape Finisterre on 22nd July, and while the subsequent movements
of those fleets were not yet definitely known. Baird's
expedition at Cork was destined for the reduction of the Cape
(ever Pitt's pre-occupation) so soon as the way was fairly safe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have just seen Lord Hawkesbury and Lord Barham, Adm<sup>l</sup>
Cornwallis having anticipated your intentions by detaching 20 sail of
the line off Ferrol, and the wind being now favourable, it appears to us
that no time should be lost in ordering Sir D. Baird to sail. As L<sup>d</sup> H.
and L<sup>d</sup> B. seem to entertain no doubt of your approving of this step, I
shall send the orders without delay. I shall remain in town tonight and
be at your disposal as best suits your engagements.</p>

<p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 20%">Ever yours,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Castlereagh.</span></p>
</div>


<p>The most interesting words in this letter are "your intentions."
They seem to imply that the plan of detaching part of Admiral
Cornwallis's fleet off Brest to the assistance of Calder off the
North West of Spain was originally Pitt's own, not Lord Barham's,
as has been hitherto supposed. They must not be pressed too
much; for the advice of Barham, First Lord of the Admiralty,
must have been paramount. Nevertheless the proposal was
evidently Pitt's as well as Barham's. The fact that Cornwallis
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>anticipated it bespeaks the resolve alike of Ministers and the
admiral at all costs to stop Villeneuve off Finisterre and prevent
the naval concentration in French waters on which Napoleon
laid so much stress. The success of the British counter-stroke
is well known. Villeneuve, having been roughly handled by
Calder, put into Ferrol, and finally, a prey to discouragement,
made off for Cadiz, thus upsetting Napoleon's scheme for the
invasion of England. In due course Nelson returned to England
for a brief time of rest at "dear, dear Merton," and then set off
on his last cruise. Before his departure he had an interview with
Pitt at Downing Street&mdash;the only occasion, I believe, on which
they met&mdash;and found in the ante-room Sir Arthur Wellesley,
just returned from India. At the end of the interview Pitt
flattered the great seaman by an act of attention which he thus
described: "Mr. Pitt paid me a compliment, which, I believe,
he would not have paid to a Prince of the Blood. When I rose
to go, he left the room with me and attended me to the carriage."
By attentions such as these Chatham was wont to stimulate the
patriotism of our warriors; and on this occasion his son played
an equally inspiriting part. Imagination strives to picture the
scene, especially when England's greatest statesman and greatest
seaman passed through the ante-room where stood the future
victor of Waterloo.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a></p>

<p>Never again were those three heroes to meet. Nelson departed
for Trafalgar. Pitt resumed the work which was wearing
him to death, nerved, however, by the consciousness that the
despatch of Nelson to the Mediterranean would foil Napoleon's
project of making that sea a French lake, "the principal aim of
my policy" as he declared it to be. In that quarter, then, Pitt
won a decisive victory which was destined to save not only that
sea, but the Continent from the domination of France. Whether
a glimpse of the future course of events opened out to the
wearied gaze of the statesman we know not. All we know is
that in mid-December, when the "Victory" lay jury-masted
and wind-bound for three days off Walmer Castle, the Lord
Warden was at Bath, in hope of gaining health and strength
for a struggle which concerned him even more nearly than that
in the Mediterranean, namely, the liberation of North Germany
and the Dutch Netherlands from the Napoleonic yoke.</p>

<p class="title spaced">THE LAST STRUGGLE</p>

<p class="quote">Heavens! What has Prussia to answer for! For nothing less, in my
mind, than every calamity which has befallen Europe for more than ten
years.&mdash;<span class="smcap">General Paget to Sir Arthur Paget</span>, <i>24th January 1806</i>.</p>


<p>The opening moves in the great game between Pitt and
Napoleon were divided with a curious evenness. As we
have seen, the French Emperor's defiant annexation of Genoa
obliterated the anger of the Czar at Pitt's insistence on the retention
of Malta; and if Pitt's high-handed conduct forced Spain to
declare against England, yet, on the other hand, Napoleon wantonly
challenged Austria and Russia to a conflict. The first
events of the war showed a similar balance. On 20th October
the French Emperor compelled the Austrian commander,
General Mack, to surrender at or near Ulm in Swabia with almost
the whole of an army of some 70,000 men. On the next
day Nelson destroyed the French and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar.
So quickly did the forcefulness or ineptitude of four commanders
determine the course of events. By the end of October
the tricolour waved triumphant over Central Europe; but the
Union Jack was thenceforth scarcely challenged by sea; and
Britain began to exert that unseen but resistless pressure upon
her enemy which gradually edged him to his ruin. Consequently
the appalling failures of the Third Coalition on land only delayed
the final triumph on which the serene genius of Pitt surely
counted.</p>

<p>At first everything seemed to favour his designs. Part of
Napoleon's army in its hurried march from North Germany
towards Ulm violated the neutrality of the Prussian principality
of Anspach, apparently by command of the Emperor. This
short cut to success nearly entailed disaster; for it earned the
sharp resentment of Prussia at a time when he especially valued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
her friendship. Indeed, so soon as he resolved to turn the
"Army of England" against Austria, he despatched his most
trusted aide-de-camp, Duroc, to Berlin, to tempt that Court with
that alluring bait, Hanover. Russia and England were, however,
making equal efforts in the hope of gaining the help of the magnificent
army of Frederick William&nbsp;III. For a time Pitt also
hoped to add the South German States, and in all to set in
motion a mass of 650,000 men against France, Austria contributing
250,000, Russia 180,000, Prussia 100,000 (later on he
bargained for 180,000), Sardinia 25,000, Naples 20,000, Sweden
16,000, and the small German States the remainder. Napoleon,
on the other hand, strove to paralyse the efforts of the Coalition
by securing the alliance or the friendly neutrality of Prussia.
With 200,000 hostile or doubtful troops on her frontier, Austria
could do little, and Russia still less. Further, as he still had
French troops in one or two fortresses of Hanover, he could
utter the words so often on the lips of Bismarck&mdash;<span lang="la">Beati possidentes</span>.
Hanover belonged of right to George&nbsp;III; but Napoleon
could will it away to Prussia.</p>

<p>Thus the fortunes of Europe depended largely on Frederick
William. Unfortunately he was incapable of rising to the
height of the situation; for he utterly lacked the virile qualities
which raised the House of Hohenzollern above petty compeers
in Swabia to fame and prosperity. Essentially mediocre, and
conscious of his slender endowments, he, like Louis&nbsp;XVI, nearly
always hesitated, and therefore generally lost. His character
was a dull compound of negations. Prone neither to vice nor to
passion, he was equally devoid of charm and graciousness.
Freezing men by his coldness, he failed to overawe them by
superiority; and, with a weak man's dislike of genius and
strength, he avoided great men, preferring trimmers like Haugwitz
and Lombard, who played upon his foibles, and saved him
from disagreeable decisions. The commanding personality of
Stein inspired in him nervous dislike which deepened into peevish
dread. Only in the depths of disaster, into which his own weakness
was to plunge him, did he have recourse to that saviour of
Prussia.</p>

<p>By the side of Frederick William was that radiant figure, Queen
Louisa, who recalls the contrast between Marie Antoinette and
her uninteresting, hapless spouse. For Louisa, too, had ambition
and the power of inspiring devotion, though etiquette and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
jealousy forbade her intervention in affairs of State;<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> otherwise
the Prussian Government would have shaken off that paralysing
indecision which left its people friendless and spiritless on the
bursting of the storm a year later. For the present, the King's
chief adviser, Hardenberg, sought to impart to Prussian policy a
trend more favourable to England and Russia. Conscious of the
need of a better frontier on the west and of the longing of his
master for the greater part of Hanover, he sought to attain this
end by means not wholly opposed to the feelings of George&nbsp;III
and the policy of Pitt. Above all, he strove to end the humiliating
subservience of his Court to France, which galled the spirit
of all patriotic Prussians. Their great desire was to join the new
Coalition even though such a step entailed war with Napoleon.
They rejoiced at the news of Admiral Calder's victory off
Finisterre, and hailed every sign of war at St. Petersburg and
Vienna.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> On the other hand, the French party was strong at
Court. Haugwitz, its head, was still nominally Minister for
Foreign Affairs, and, though often absent for long periods on
his Silesian domain, resumed the control of them when he returned
to Berlin. This singular arrangement enabled the King
to keep up the game of political see-saw which brought relief to
him, disgust to his would-be allies, and ruin to his country.</p>

<p>To tilt the balance in favour of the Coalition was now the
chief aim of Pitt. And who shall say that, if Prussia, with
strength still unimpaired, had played the part which her enfeebled
people insisted on taking up in 1813, the doom of
Napoleon might not have been assured in the autumn and winter
which we associate with the names of Ulm and Austerlitz? All
this was possible, nay, probable, had Frederick William surveyed
the situation with the sound judgement of Pitt. But the British
statesman laboured under one great disadvantage. He could not
offer to Prussia what she most wanted. He could do no more
than promise to extend her western confines to Antwerp and
Ostend; and she far preferred Hanover, as solidifying her
straggling western lands, without bringing her near to France.
Here was an almost insuperable obstacle; and we can imagine
that, like his father, he cursed Britain's connection with Hanover.
His chief hope was, that Prussia would discern her true interest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>in acquiring less by honourable means than very much from
Napoleon, whose gifts were often perilous. Russia, too, at that
time seemed to adopt the British view of the Hanoverian question;
and in the early autumn that Power mustered her second
army on the borders of Prussia in a highly threatening manner.
Finally, the Czar declared that if his troops were refused a
passage through Silesia, he would make his way by force, the
Pitt Cabinet informing him that, in that case, the liberal subsidies
intended for Prussia, would be added to those already on their
way to St. Petersburg. But even threats failed to bring Frederick
William to a decision; and Hardenberg announced that a
forcible entry of the Russians would involve war with Prussia.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a></p>

<p>While Frederick William fumed at the Muscovite threats,
came news of the violation of his Anspach domain on 3rd October.
At once he declared his intention to avenge the insult and
to expel Duroc from Prussian territory. He also raised high the
hopes of the Allies by allowing the Russians to enter Silesia, and
by favouring Pitt's plan of a joint expedition of the Allies to
Hanover with a view to the liberation of Holland; and when
he ordered the mobilization of the whole Prussian army, there
appeared good grounds for expecting the speedy accession of at
least 150,000 troops trained in the school of Frederick the Great.
Even Haugwitz now suggested that if war came England must
give Prussia a subsidy.<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> The Anglophil party at Berlin raised
its head in triumph at the approach of the Russian Emperor;
and when on 28th October he entered Berlin with enthusiastic
greetings from the populace, Europe seemed about to be leagued
against Napoleon. Chivalry and prudence alike counselled such
a union, for on the morrow arrived news of the annihilation
of Mack's army. Nothing but prompt action could save Germany
from the Napoleonic deluge.</p>

<p>The first rumours of the disaster at Ulm did not reach London
until 2nd November. Lord Malmesbury was dining with Pitt
and mentioned the report to him, whereupon the Prime Minister
exclaimed in loud and angry tones, "Don't believe a word of it:
it is all a fiction."<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> But on the morrow a Dutch newspaper was
brought, and Malmesbury translated the account, which was so
clear and detailed as to leave little room for doubt. Pitt's countenance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
changed. There came over him that look which his
friends saw imprinted more deeply with every week of deepening
gloom. For a brief space it passed away. On 6th November
London heard the joyful yet painful news of Trafalgar. It
reached Downing Street at 3 a.m. Pitt was so moved by conflicting
emotions that he, the soundest of sleepers, could not find
repose, but roused himself for work. The Stock Exchange registered
the swift oscillations from confidence to doubt, for
though all fear of the French and Spanish fleet was at an end,
yet, as Nelson perished, national security seemed imperilled, and
Consols sank.</p>

<p>The contrast between the victorious constancy of Britain and
the wavering and hapless counsels of the Germanic States inspired
Pitt with one of the most magnanimous utterances of that
age. At the Lord Mayor's banquet on 9th November, that
dignitary proposed his health as the Saviour of Europe. Pitt
concentrated his reply into these two memorable sentences:
"I return you many thanks for the honour you have done me;
but Europe is not to be saved by any single man. England has
saved herself by her exertions, and will, as I trust, save Europe
by her example." In its terseness and strength, its truth and
modesty, its patriotism and hopefulness, this utterance stands
unrivalled. The effect must have been all the greater because
Pitt then bore on his countenance signs of that anxious forethought
in which now lay the chief hope of European independence.</p>

<p>Six days before the arrival of news of the Austrian disaster,
Pitt had sought to expedite a union with Prussia. In view of the
urgency of the case, he decided to send his trusted friend, the
Earl of Harrowby, the Dudley Ryder of former days. Harrowby's
great abilities have never met with due recognition,
probably owing to the persistent ill health which impaired alike
his equanimity and his power of work; but Wilberforce had
good cause for commending Pitt's choice; and he added in a
letter of 25th October that the capacity of Harrowby was rated
far higher by foreigners than by Englishmen.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> The instructions
to the Earl, drafted by Lord Mulgrave on 27th October, reveal
Pitt's resolve to go very far in order to buy the support of
Prussia. They empowered Harrowby to offer her the Belgic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>provinces and such German lands as would connect them with
the Westphalian domains of Prussia. The need of money for the
immediate equipment of her army being also urgent, Harrowby
was to offer a yearly subsidy of &pound;12 10<i>s.</i> for each Prussian
soldier actually serving against France, the hope being expressed
that from 150,000 to 200,000 men would be forthcoming.
At the same time Pitt explained that at the general
peace Great Britain would restore all her acquisitions oversea,
Malta and the Cape of Good Hope alone excepted. Harrowby
was also charged to do all in his power to effect the liberation of
North Germany and Holland by the Russo-Swedish force then
mustering at Stralsund. Such were the plans of Pitt. Even in
this brief outline, their magnanimity is apparent. In order to
assure the freedom of the Continent, he was ready to pour forth
the wealth of Britain, and to sacrifice all her conquests, except
those two bulwarks of Empire, Malta and the Cape.<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> Already
even before Nelson gained the mastery of the seas at Trafalgar,
Baird's force had set sail for the reduction of the Cape. It
achieved its purpose in the month in which Pitt died. It is not
generally known that the foundation of our South African
Empire was due primarily to his foresight. The war having
originated in Napoleon's aggressions and his threats respecting
Egypt and the Orient generally, Pitt resolved that England
should thenceforth dominate both the sea route and the overland
route to the East Indies.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, owing to the fogs on the River Elbe and other
delays at Hamburg, Harrowby did not reach Berlin until the
middle of November;<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> and a fortnight earlier (3rd November)
the sovereigns of Russia and Prussia had framed the Treaty of
Potsdam. Ostensibly, it bound Prussia to side with the Allies
unless within four weeks Napoleon accepted her armed mediation,
which she proposed to offer forthwith. She required from
the French Emperor a full recognition of the independence of
Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and Naples, which of course
implied the withdrawal of French troops from those lands.
Napoleon was also to grant to the dispossessed King of Sardinia
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>the following indemnities&mdash;Genoa, Parma, and Piacenza; while
Austria was to recover Central Venetia as far as the River
Mincio. The Allies flattered themselves that Napoleon would
at once reject these terms and throw Prussia into their arms.
Such, too, was the conviction of Pitt. While regretting that France
should keep Piedmont and find no barrier opposed to her in
Holland,<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> he felt so convinced of Napoleon's refusal and of
Prussia's good faith that he prepared to satisfy her demand for
a British subsidy. Prussian troops were marching into Hanover,
as if with the aim of ousting the French and restoring the
authority of George&nbsp;III; and Hardenberg assured Harrowby in
their first interview, on 16th November, that that force would protect
the flank of the Anglo-Russian expedition then about to
enter the Electorate.</p>

<p>On the surface, then, everything seemed to augur a brilliant
success for Pitt's policy. As had happened before, the recklessness
of Napoleon favoured the British cause; and it is probable
that, if Frederick William had sent to the French headquarters
any one but Count Haugwitz, Prussia would have drawn the
sword. Napoleon was in great danger. True, he met with little
opposition in his advance to Vienna and thence into Moravia.
But the deeper he plunged into that province, the worse would
be his position if 180,000 Prussians were launched at his
flank and rear. The Court of Berlin was well aware that the
destinies of Europe lay in its hands; and for once a fatal confidence
possessed Frederick William. He and his advisers used
the crisis, not in the magnanimous spirit which impelled Pitt to
sacrifice nearly the whole of Britain's naval conquests, but in
order to assure Prussia's gain even at the expense of the solidarity
of the European League. The Coalition's extremity was
Prussia's opportunity. Hanover was her price for joining it.
Such was the purport of a secret article of the Treaty of
Potsdam, to which the Czar had most reluctantly given his
consent.</p>

<p>In order to bring the utmost possible pressure to bear upon
the British Government, a special Russian envoy, Count d'Oubril,
set out from Berlin to London, crossing Harrowby on the way.
Oubril arrived in London on or about 16th November; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>after a short delay Vorontzoff and he communicated to Pitt the
document containing the ominous demand. The Russian ambassador
noted that Pitt, despite long training in the concealment
of his feelings, displayed some emotion on reading the
fateful words. In truth, they dealt the second of the strokes
which struck him to the heart. But, collecting himself with an
effort, he informed Vorontzoff that, so great was the King's
attachment to Hanover, the patrimony of his family for upwards
of a thousand years, that no Minister would venture ever to
name the proposal, as it might either kill him or drive him mad.
All the arguments of Vorontzoff and Oubril on behalf of the
Prusso-Russian demand utterly failed. Pitt expressed a desire to
meet Prussia's wishes for a better western frontier, but never at
the expense of Hanover.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> Thus he deliberately faced a terrible
diplomatic reverse rather than expose the King to a recurrence
of his mental malady. A little later he recovered his equanimity;
for on 19th November he informed Harrowby that, though
Hanover was out of the question, yet he hoped to find an
equivalent which would satisfy Prussia. The two Emperors
could not in their present plight object to her gaining a large
accession of territory. Moreover it would be an infinite disgrace
to them now to make a separate peace with Napoleon.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>Still [he added] even if this should happen, we have a strong interest
that a separate peace should provide all the security that can be
obtained for the Continent. If decent terms are obtained, particularly
if France is obliged <em>really</em> to evacuate Holland and leave it in a state of
independence, and if the three great Continental Powers after extorting
concessions from France in the moment of victory, unite cordially in an
obligation to resist all future encroachments, not only Europe will have
gained much, but we shall have gained for the separate objects of this
country more than enough to compensate for all the expense of subsidies
in this year; and we may return to a state of separate war with
little to guard against but the single point of Boulogne and with increased
means of concentrating both our naval and land defence. The
first object therefore of my wishes is, the immediate rejection of the
mediation<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> and the <em>embarking Prussia at any rate in active and decisive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>operations</em> towards Germany and Holland, leaving it to be considered
afterwards what territorial arrangements can be agreed upon to secure
her permanent co-operation. The next would be, in the event of
negotiation, our being included in it, on the terms of restoring all our
conquests except Malta and the Cape&mdash;and the third (and tho' the worst
not a bad one) as good a separate peace as possible for our perfidious
Allies, leaving us to fight our battle for ourselves....<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a></p>
</div>


<p>Pitt's indignation against Prussia did not lead him to fling
a refusal at her. On the contrary, he sought to postpone that
announcement until the expiration of the four weeks, within
which she must make her decision to side with or against
Napoleon. Such was the purport of his letter of 23rd November
to Harrowby. He also announced an increase in the numbers of
the British force destined to serve in Hanover. This expedition
under General Don was now being pushed on with great zeal.
It met with disapproval from Canning, who with much sagacity
pointed out, on 29th November, that if the war were continued
the gain of a month or two was a trifling object; whereas, if the
Allies ended the war, France would certainly offer Hanover to
Prussia.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> The dash of pessimism in Canning's nature enabled
him to discern difficulties and dangers which were hidden from
Pitt's ever hopeful vision. Mulgrave seems to have shared Pitt's
view; for he signed all the despatches relating to the Hanoverian
expedition. On 23rd November he informed Harrowby that,
early in the year 1806, as many as 70,000 British and Hanoverian
troops would be ready for service, either in Hanover or wherever
they could be employed to most effect. He therefore
expected that by that time the Allies would have nearly
300,000 men in North Germany; and, as the resources of Austria
were not depleted by the disaster at Ulm, she and Russia
ought then to have nearly half a million of men on foot.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a></p>

<hr />

<p>Pitt's eagerness to receive news from Harrowby appears in
the closing phrases of his letter of 29th November to that
envoy: "We are counting moments till we hear in what state
you found things on your arrival [at Berlin], and what has been
Haugwitz's reception at the French headquarters." Again, on
5th December, he sent off to him a letter, which as being the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>last of any importance written by him at Downing Street, must
be given in full:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Downing St. <i>Dec. 5th, 1805</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Harrowby</span>,</p>

<p>I am grieved to hear by your letter of the 24th that you had
been so much persecuted by headaches, and that you had allowed the
secret article of Potsdam [<span lang="la">sic</span>] to give you so much uneasiness. You
must I am sure be satisfied that the way in which you have treated it is
<em>the best possible</em>, because it gives no hopes of the thing being consented
to, and at the same time avoids the necessity of any formal and official
negative. The great object I think is that Prussia should if possible,
decide on the result of C<sup>t</sup> Haugwitz's mission, without giving to the evil
councillors of the King of Prussia the advantage of stating to him that
this object is precluded for ever. At the same time we cannot in good
faith give the least assurance that it is likely to be ever attainable.
Woronzow [Vorontzoff] who has been in town for ten days but is gone
again, writes to Alopeus that he has received from him the <span lang="fr">m&eacute;moire
raisonn&eacute;</span> on the exchange of Hanover, but cannot present it to us till
he has orders to do so from his own Court. We are therefore supposed
to know nothing more of the matter.</p>

<p>On the whole state of things, you will perhaps be angry with me for
saying that my hopes are still sanguine. I think I see great chance of
Prussia agreeing to co-operate either for a definite object or a limited
time, in return for subsidies and for our assurance (which you know to
be a very sincere one) of wishing to procure for them important acquisitions.
The question of Hanover may I think be left aloof. As to plans
of operations, it is almost idle to say anything. But you will have seen
that we think the first and <em>essential</em> point is to act (as Prussia seems to
intend) with a force sure of success in the rear of the French Army in
Germany. Still I cannot conceive what can be the military reasons why
an attack on Holland should not take place at the same time, or at least
should not be prepared so as to be put into execution whenever the
effect of any great success of the Allies, or a frost, or an appearance of
good disposition in the country, should afford a favourable opening for
such an enterprise, the advantages of which in its impression and consequences
I need not state to you. We have finally decided with a view
to this chance and for the sake of shewing at any rate our readiness to
co-operate, to send the 12,000 men which have been prepared, to Embden
[<span lang="la">sic</span>], and if this wind continues, I hope they will sail within three
days. Endeavour to make Prussia send under General Kalkreuth (or
whoever may be the general they destine for that quarter) not merely
10,000 men, but enough to make such an army as can scarce be resisted.
Our force with the Russians (exclusive of the Swedes and after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>allowing for something to watch Hameln<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>) will be near 40,000 men. It
surely cannot be difficult for Prussia to add 30,000 to that number
within a very few weeks on increased subsidies beyond the number they
now propose, and that without at all impairing the effort against Bonaparte's
army. As to your stay at Berlin I can only say that if your
health will permit, <em>everything that we value most</em> may depend on your
remaining till you have seen the leading points of the negociation fairly
through. As to details with Saxony and Hesse, they cannot be worth
your waiting for, if they require any time, which, however, supposing you
once to settle with Prussia, they cannot. The important moment seems
to be that when the issue of Haugwitz's negociation shall have been
known in Berlin and time given to communicate with Austria and
Russia on the result. Under these circumstances it will I am afraid
hardly be as pleasant to you as it is to me to know that Parliament will
not meet till the 21st of Jan<sup>y</sup> [1806] and that you have not on that account
any reason for your immediate return. If, however, (as I most
earnestly hope will not be the case) you should really find the fatigue
and anxiety too much for you, it is certainly among <em>the things that we
value most</em>, that you should return, having suffered as little as possible.
A frigate will be sent to wait your orders at the Elbe, but I hope you
will have no occasion to use it, till after you have signed a provisional
treaty, and seen the Prussians on their march against the enemy.</p>

<p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 20%">Ever most sincerely yours</p>

<p class="letter">W. P.</p>
</div>


<p>Three days before Pitt poured forth this sanguine forecast,
Napoleon struck the Coalition to the heart. As "the sun of
Austerlitz" set, the two Emperors were in flight eastwards,
while their armies streamed after them in hopeless rout, or
struggled through the funnel of death between the two lakes
(2nd December). Marbot's story of thousands of Russians
sinking majestically under the ice is a piece of melodrama. But
the reality was such as to stun the survivors. In his dazed
condition the Emperor Francis forthwith sent proposals for a
truce. It proved to be the precursor of the armistice of 6th
December, which involved the departure of the Russian army
and the exclusion of that of Prussia from Austrian territories.
In the calculating balance maintained at Berlin, this diplomatic
surrender proved to be a greater calamity than the military
disaster. True, the news of the battle caused consternation; but
for the present Frederick William held firm and on 8th December<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
ordered part of the Prussian army (now 192,000 strong)
to enter Bohemia for the succour of the Allies.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> Not until after
the 13th, after the arrival of news of the armistice, did he seek to
evade his obligations to Russia; and, obviously, a new situation
arose when Alexander gave up the campaign, and Francis promised
to bar out the Prussians. Hardenberg sought to hide from
Harrowby this change of front, hinting, however, that Prussia
might have to consult her own interests. In the light of the
events of 1795, that phrase was clear enough; and Harrowby
forthwith sent orders to General Don to countermand the
advance of his troops towards Hanover.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a></p>

<p>To complete this chapter of misfortunes, Harrowby's health
broke down. On discovering the truth about Prussia's secret
demand for Hanover, he fell into the depths of despair and
nervous prostration, as appears from the postscript of his letter
of 24th November to Pitt:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>This horrible secret article has finished me. It stood with its
mouth open, and from mere cowardice I have run into it, and it will
devour me. I am persuaded, however, that it would equally have
caught me if I had run away. There is something, however, in every
view of it which agonises me. I am anxious beyond imagination to
know what passes in England upon it and conclude I shall by the next
newspaper. Would it be impossible to prevail upon the King to listen
to the idea of a sort of Barrier-treaty for Hanover, which would give
Prussia a military frontier but not the territorial possession?<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>
</div>


<p>On 8th December, after hearing the first news of Austerlitz,
he writes in equally dolorous strains, concluding with a request
that Pitt would send a frigate to the mouth of the Elbe to bring
away his coffin. Again he writes in these pathetic terms:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Most secret.</i></p>

<p class="letter">Berlin, <i>12 Dec. 1805</i>.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Pitt</span>,</p>

<p>The current of events has been so rapid, and the embarrassments
they produce from every quarter is [<span lang="la">sic</span>] so intolerable, that,
weakened as my brain has been by nervous spasms of giddiness, I hardly
keep my senses. Cool judgment is required; and I can only take steps
in a state of agitation&mdash;repent; and there is something more to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>repented of. I shall not long stand it; but, in the meantime, what mischief
may not have happened! The sacrifice of myself is nothing. All
is over with me even if I survive. I am tolerably at intervals, but every
fresh occurrence brings with it distraction. I tremble at the consequences.
You can conceive no state of mind, or rather of mind and
body operating upon each other; you cannot even pity it; you can only
despise it. Good God. If it be possible, do not betray me. I may
recover. I try to disguise my feelings. I write to my wife with affected
cheerfulness. She would not survive. For heaven's sake, keep this to
yourself.</p>

<p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 20%">Yours ever,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Harrowby</span>.</p>
</div>


<p>To what mistake Harrowby here alludes is a mystery. But
George Jackson states that he had three fits at Berlin, besides
spasms every day. Indeed his state was so pitiable that his
selection for this difficult post was matter of general comment.
The physicians strongly urged him to return to England at
once.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> Pitt cannot have received Harrowby's pathetic confession
when he replied as follows, probably to the letter of the 8th:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Bath, <i>Dec. 21st, 1805</i>.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Harrowby</span>,</p>

<p>I was prevented from writing a few lines as I intended by the
messenger we sent from hence yesterday. We are sending orders for
another today to pass through Berlin on his way to the Emperor's
head-quarters, to remind them of sending the ratification which we have
never yet received. We have nothing very authentic from the armies
later than your despatch of the 9th by estafette, but there are accounts
thro' Hamburg from Berlin of the 10th, corroborated by reports from
various quarters, which lead us to hope that the sequel of the battle
at length terminated in great success on the part of Russia. If this
proves true, I flatter myself your subsidiary treaty will have been soon
brought to a prosperous issue, and you will be delivered from all your
fatigue and anxiety. I am quite grieved to think how much you have
suffered, tho' I trust your complaint is only temporary, and that a good
battle and a good treaty will send you back to us in better health than
you went. I see no danger of your exceeding our limit in the amount
of subsidy, as we looked if necessary to an actual annual payment of
&pound;3,000,000, and the number proposed in the treaty, of 180,000
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>Prussians and 40,000 Allies, will not require more than &pound;2,750,000,
which still leaves room for 25,000 men more if they are wanted and can
be had. I have been here for ten days and have already felt the effect
of the waters in a pretty smart fit of the gout from which I am just
recovering, and of which I expect soon to perceive the benefit.</p>

<p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 20%">Ever yours,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">W. Pitt.</span></p>

<p>I need hardly tell you that every step you have taken has been exactly
what we should have desired.</p>
</div>


<p>He who wrote these cheering words was in worse health than
Harrowby. The latter lived on till the year 1847; Pitt had now
taken his last journey but one. Sharp attacks of gout had reduced
him to so weak and tremulous a state that he could
scarcely lift a glass to his lips. So wrote Mrs. Jackson on 9th
December, long before the news of Austerlitz reached these
shores.<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> So far back as 27th November, Canning, in prophetic
strains, begged him not to defer a projected visit to Bath until
it was too late for the waters to do him good. But "the pilot
that weathered the storm" refused to leave the tiller in case
decisive news came from Harrowby. He also prepared to
strengthen his Cabinet against the attacks certain to be made
in the ensuing session, by including in it two excellent speakers,
Canning and Charles Yorke, the latter taking the Board of
Control. Why he did not complete these changes, as Canning
begged him to do, is far from clear. Possibly the sharp though
friendly criticism which Canning levelled against the Anglo-Russian
expedition to Hanover made him apprehensive of
divisions in the Cabinet on a question which was very near his
heart. Certainly much could be said in favour of an expedition
to Walcheren, which Canning urged should be entrusted to
General M[oore?]. Pitt preferred the Hanoverian enterprise,
doubtless because it would lay Russia and Prussia under a debt
of honour to co-operate to the utmost of their power.</p>

<p>At last the strain became too great, and on 7th December Pitt
set out for Bath, arriving there on the 11th. He resided at
Harrowby's house, 11, Laura Place. His stay in Bath aroused
interest so intense that he found it necessary to vary the time of
his visits to the Pump Room in order to escape the crowd
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>which would otherwise have incommoded him.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> As has just
appeared, he expected a speedy recovery; for, as was the case
with his father, if the attack of gout ran a normal course, the
system felt relief. Freedom from worry was the first condition
of amendment. After his retirement from office in 1768 Chatham
recovered so quickly that his opponents gibed at the illness
as a political device.<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> Ten years later he succumbed to excitement
and strain.</p>

<p>During the first part of his stay at Bath, Pitt was in good
spirits and wrote cheerfully about his health. The following
letter to his London physician, Sir Walter Farquhar, is not that
of a man who feels death approaching:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letter">Bath, <i>Dec. 15. 1805</i>.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

<p>The gout continues pretty smartly in my foot; and I find from
Mr. Crooks that it is attended with a feverish pulse and some other
symptoms of the same nature. I have communicated to Mr. Crooks
your directions, and he is to send me the saline draughts with some
little addition, which he will explain to you. I thought he would detail
symptoms more precisely than I could, and have therefore desired him
to write to you. On the whole, I have no doubt the plan you have laid
down will answer, and I do not at present see the smallest occasion to
accept your kind and friendly offer of coming here.</p>

<p>P.S. 4.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> I enclose Mr. Crooks' letter to you. His account to
me of the pulse was that it was not strong, but quick and beating near
an hundred. One of the saline draughts which I have taken since I
wrote the foregoing letter, seems, as far as I can judge from feeling,
already to have had a very good effect.</p>
</div>


<p>Not until ten days later do we find signs of alarm in the letters
of his friends; for it is characteristic of his buoyant nature that
he never wrote despondingly about himself. There is a well-known
story to the effect that, on hearing the news of Austerlitz,
he called for a map of Europe, to see where the place was,
and then said with a sigh: "Roll up that map: it will not be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>wanted these ten years." One version assigns the incident to
Shockerwick House, near Bath. Pitt is looking over the picture
gallery, and is gazing at Gainsborough's portrait of the actor
Quin. His retentive memory calls up the lines in Churchill's
"Characters":</p>


<p class="poem">
Nature, in spite of all his skill, crept in&mdash;<br />
Horatio, Dorax, Falstaff&mdash;still 'twas Quin.<br />
</p>


<p>At that moment he hears the beat of a horse's hoofs. A courier
dashes up. He comes in, splashed with mud, hands the despatches.
Pitt tears them open and hurriedly reads them. His
countenance changes, he calls for brandy, then for a map, and
is finally helped to his carriage, uttering the historic phrase.<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>
In another version he mournfully rolls out the words to
Lady Hester Stanhope, as she welcomes him in the hall of
Bowling Green House, after his last journey to his home on
Putney Heath.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> The words probably fell from him on some
occasion. But at the risk of incurring the charge of pedantry, I
must point out that the news of Austerlitz did not come on him
as one overwhelming shock: it filtered through by degrees. As
we have seen, he wrote to Harrowby on 21st December, stating
that reports from Berlin and other quarters represented the
sequel to the battle as a great success for the Russians. It
appears that Thornton, our envoy at Hamburg, wrote as follows
on 13th December to Mulgrave: "From everything I can learn
(for the details are even yet far from being circumstantial
and decisive) the tide of success had completely turned in
favour of the Russian and Austrian armies, tho', as the conflict
still continued to the 4th and perhaps to the 5th, it could
not be positively said on which side the victory had been declared.
The certain intelligence cannot now be long delayed."<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a></p>

<p>Castlereagh also, writing to Pitt on 19th December, assured
him that he had heard similar news through various channels,
and therefore cherished high hopes that something good had
happened.<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> Mulgrave, who was then also at Bath along with
Bathurst, Hawkesbury, and Canning, shared these hopes. Despite
the first reports of Austerlitz, which were promptly contradicted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
the Ministerial circle at Bath had no want of diversion.
On 12th December Mulgrave sent to Pitt a short poem on
Trafalgar for his correction, and Pitt touched up a few lines.
On 21st December Mulgrave wrote to him: "I send you
Woronzow [Vorontzoff] and Ward, <span lang="fr">faute de mieux</span>. I was rejoiced
to find you were gone out in your carriage when I called
at your home after church. As Bathurst, Canning, and the
gout have left you, I hope you will be able to return to the mess
to-morrow." This does not imply that Pitt was living the life of
an invalid, or was kept to so strict a diet as during his sojourn
at Bath three years before.</p>

<p>Equally hopeful was the estimate of Canning. He spent a
week with Pitt at Bath, and, after leaving him shortly before
Christmas, informed a friend that Pitt was "recovering from a
fit of the gout, which has done him abundance of good, and puts
off the time of his driving after old Frere&mdash;I trust to an incalculable
distance.... There wants only an official confirmation of
all the good news (that has reached us through every possible
channel except those of Office) to complete it."<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a></p>

<p>Canning, we may note here, had discussed with Pitt his projected
poem&mdash;"Ulm and Trafalgar" (which bore the motto
"Look here, upon this picture, and on that"). It began:</p>


<p class="poem">
While Austria's yielded armies, vainly brave,<br />
Moved, in sad pomp, by Danube's blood-stained wave<br />
</p>


<p>and ended with a noble acclaim to Nelson:</p>


<p class="poem">
Thou, bravest, gentlest Spirit, fare thee well.
</p>


<p>On the first line Canning plumed himself until he remembered
the warning of an old tutor at Magdalen, that when anything in
your verses pleased you very much, it was best to strike it out.
Canning referred the phrase "yielded armies" to Pitt, who
probably found relief from his cares in touching up the poem.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>
That Christmastide, then, was a time of anxiety, but not of
settled gloom. There is no sign that Pitt or his colleagues felt
the position to be desperate until the end of the year. On
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>Christmas Day Castlereagh wrote from Downing Street to Pitt:
"I am sorry to add to your materials for criticism and speculation.
I send you Cooke's 'Courant,' There is intelligence in the
City from Amsterdam of the 21st. Nothing official known here
of an <span lang="fr">armistice</span>. You have received from Lord B[arham?] every
information from that quarter."<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, the hopefulness of Ministers now involved them in
greater difficulties. Building on Prussia's promises, they decided
early in December to order the despatch of strong reinforcements
to the British corps then on the point of entering
Hanover.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> In all, as many as 65,000 British and King's Germans
were to be sent&mdash;the largest force that had ever set sail from these
shores, a fact which testifies to the ardour of Pitt's desires for
the liberation of Hanover and Holland. Even the immediate
results of this decision were disastrous. Sixty-seven transports,
forthwith setting sail, encountered a terrible storm, which flung
three of them on the enemy's coast, while one sank with all hands
on the Goodwins. Such was the purport of the news sent by
Castlereagh to Pitt at Bath on 19th December. He added that,
in spite of these losses, "the little Cabinet of five" (with Lord
Barham in attendance) decided to order all the remaining transports
to sail, so that Prussia might be encouraged to "throw her
strength to the southward. We have acted for the best, and I
hope you and your companions will approve."<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> Pitt, of course,
did approve, not knowing that while England was encountering
heavy risks in order to effect the liberation of North Germany,
her Allies had come to terms with Napoleon.</p>

<p>At last, on 29th December, definite news concerning the armistice
of 4th December reached London. It must have chilled
the hearts of the boldest. For, trusting in the continued exertions
of the Allies, England had sent to North Germany as
many as 257 transports, and of these 8 were now known to be
lost, involving the death of 664 men, and the capture of about
1,000 on the enemies' coasts. All this effort and loss of life
now appeared to be useless, in view of the vacillating conduct
of Prussia. Only with her good will could the British troops,
with the Russian and Swedish contingents, hope to conquer
Holland. If she declared against us, the whole force would be
in jeopardy. Such were the tidings which Castlereagh bore with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>him to Pitt at the end of the year.<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> Not a line survives respecting
that mournful interview; but we can picture the deathly
look coming over Pitt's emaciated features as he now for the
first time faced the prospect of the dissolution of the mighty
league which he had toiled to construct. Probably it was this
shock to the system which brought on a second attack of
the gout, accompanied with great weakness and distaste for
food.<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless he clung to the hope that Prussia would stand
firm. On 3rd January 1806 further news reached him from the
Austrian and Prussian Governments. The Austrian despatches
represented Austerlitz as a repulse, but not a disaster, and the
armistice as a device for enabling Prussia to prepare her blow at
Napoleon's flank or rear. On 5th January Mulgrave found in
the despatches from Berlin grounds for believing that that Court
might under certain conditions assist the two Emperors in Moravia
and the British force in Hanover. On the morrow he wrote
to Pitt in emphatic terms, urging him to offer to Prussia the
Dutch Republic. That little State (he urged) could not again
be independent, save in circumstances now scarcely imaginable,
much less realizable. Further, the Stadholder having very
tamely accepted the domain of Fulda as an indemnity, we need
feel no qualms for the House of Nassau; and, as Prussia was
influenced solely by territorial greed, and Hanover was out of the
question, she might well acquire the Dutch Netherlands, which
would link her to British interests.<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> Again we have to admit
ignorance of Pitt's opinion on this degrading proposal. Certainly
it never took definite shape.<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> Though willing to assign to Prussia
the Belgic Netherlands, he laid great stress on the independence
of the Dutch Netherlands, which indeed was the corner-stone of
his foreign policy. Moreover, to barter away an unoffending little
State was to repeat the international crimes of the partitions of
Poland and Venetia. We may be sure that that proud and just
spirit would rather have perished than stoop to such ignominy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span></p>
<p>In effect, he fell a victim to his resolve never to barter away
the patrimony of George&nbsp;III. We now know that Prussia's
policy at this crisis turned mainly on the acquisition of Hanover.
Her envoy, Haugwitz, whom she sent to Napoleon's headquarters
charged with the offer of Prussia's armed mediation on behalf of
Europe, had on 15th December signed with him the humiliating
Convention of Sch&ouml;nbrunn, whereby Prussia agreed to make
certain cessions of territory on condition of acquiring Hanover.
About Christmastide Frederick William decided to close with
this offer, which involved the expulsion of the Anglo-Russian
force from the Electorate. Premonitory signs of this change of
front were soon visible at Berlin. Indeed, the trend of Prussian
policy during the last decade prepared the British Ministry for
the ruin of their hopes. Pitt must have been racked with anxiety
lest Prussia should doff the lion's skin and don that of the jackal;
for he alone knew of the nervous breakdown of Harrowby.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the hope of helping on that negotiation from
Downing Street, added to the verdict of Sir Walter Farquhar
that the Bath waters were now of no avail, which induced him on
9th January to set out on his homeward journey. He was believed
to be in better health than at the time of his arrival; such
at least was the announcement of the "Bath Herald" on the 11th;
and his hopeful outlook appears in a curious detail which afterwards
came to light. In order to beguile the tedium of the journey
he had taken out from a circulating library in Bath the following
works, each in two volumes, "The Secret History of the
Court of Petersburg," and Schiller's "History of the Thirty Years'
War."<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> A man who believes death to be near does not undertake
a study of the manifold intrigues of Catharine&nbsp;II, or of the
Thirty Years' War. He also had the prospect of seeing the liveliest
and most devoted of friends, Canning, at his country home,
South Hill, Bracknell, in Windsor Forest. Canning sent the invitation
on the 5th, and it was accepted on the 8th in terms
which implied a sojourn of some days. He offered to accompany
him from Bath, if he felt strong enough to converse on the way;
but Pitt declined this offer, and it is doubtful whether he stayed
at South Hill; for Malmesbury declares that he had to remain a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>long time in bed at Reading. On the other hand the Bishop of
Lincoln declared that the journey took only two days, and that
at its close Pitt showed no very marked signs of fatigue. Lady
Hester Stanhope, however, was shocked by his wasted appearance
on reaching his home, Bowling Green House, on Putney
Heath.</p>

<p>Some eighteen months earlier he had leased that residence.
It stands on the (old) Portsmouth Road, and had earlier been an
inn frequented by lovers of that game and patrons of cockfighting.
After enlargement it had been converted into a gentleman's
abode which well suited the modest requirements of
Pitt and of his niece, Lady Hester Stanhope.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> There, not far
from the scenes of his youthful frolics with Wilberforce, and
only a quarter of a mile from the dell where he fought the duel
with Tierney, he found solace from the ever-increasing cares of
state. In those last months Hester felt for him feelings akin to
adoration.</p>

</div>


<p>On the morrow, Sunday, their circle was enlarged by the
arrival of his old friend and counsellor, Bishop Tomline, who
was shocked at the change which had taken place in him since
he left for Bath. The physicians, Farquhar, Reynolds, and Baillie,
however, saw no cause for alarm, the only disquieting symptoms
being intense weakness and dislike of animal food. There is a
forcibly significant phrase in a recent letter of George Rose to
Tomline, that he dreaded the effect on the invalid of an excessive
use of medicines.<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> Evidently Rose believed the digestive
organs to be impaired by this habit. Pitt's daily potations of
port wine for many years past must further have told against
recovery. Whether Farquhar and his colleagues cut off medicine
and sought to build up that emaciated frame is uncertain. All
that we know is that they prescribed complete quiet, and therefore
requested the bishop to open all Pitt's letters so as to preclude
all chance of excitement.</p>

<p>On 12th January, Pitt wrote an affectionate letter to the Marquis
Wellesley, welcoming him on his return from his memorable
Vice-royalty in India. He begged him to come to Bowling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>Green House at the earliest opportunity. The letter closes with
these remarkable words: "I am recovering rather slowly from a
series of stomach complaints, followed by severe attacks of gout,
but I believe I am now in the way of real amendment."<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> The
Bishop also describes him as gaining ground until Monday the
13th. On that day he went out in his coach in the morning, but
in the evening Lords Castlereagh and Hawkesbury, having obtained
permission from the physicians to interview their chief,
communicated news which had a most agitating effect. Pitt
afterwards assured the Bishop "that he felt during that conversation
some sensation in his stomach which he feared it might
be difficult to remove."<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> It is surprising that the physicians
allowed an interview of an agitating nature; but the ministerial
pressure brought to bear on them may have overborne their
better judgement. In matters of Cabinet discipline Pitt was an
autocrat, insisting that no important action should be taken
without his cognizance. Probably, then, it was his own sense of
responsibility which exposed him to the death blow.</p>

<p>Certainly the question at issue was of the gravest kind.
Should Ministers order the return of the British reinforcements
last sent to Hanover? That expedition was the work of Pitt.
He it was who had reared the fabric of a European Coalition;
and, even after the withdrawal of Austria, he clung to the hope
that Prussia would take her place, and, with the help of British,
Prussian, Russian, and Swedish troops, drive the French from
North Germany and the Dutch Republic. How could his colleagues
order back a large part of the British force, thereby
justifying the vacillations of Prussia and ensuring a parliamentary
triumph to Fox and Grenville? And yet Ministers knew,
better than Pitt could know, the danger of relying on the Court
of Berlin. Though not yet fully aware of its resolve to take Napoleon's
side, they had strong reasons for expecting this course of
action; and in that case the British expedition would be in grave
danger between the Prussians on the east, the Franco-Dutch forces
on the south-west and the ice-floes which were forming on the
River Weser. Prudence counselled the timely return of our
troops who were yet on board ship at or near Bremen.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> Patriotic
pride prompted a bold offensive. But the King and Pitt alone
could utter the decisive words. The King approved the return
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>of the last reinforcements, and Pitt, it seems, must have conceded
the point. But the concession struck him to the heart. It
was the last of the deadly stabs which fate dealt him thick and
fast in his time of weakness.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, on the morrow he drove out in his carriage, but
was visibly weaker than before the interview. For a few minutes
he saw his brother and then Lord Wellesley. The latter found
his mind as clear as ever; and he uttered these remarkable
words about Sir Arthur Wellesley: "He states every difficulty
before he undertakes any service, but none after he has undertaken
it." What a prophecy of Vittoria and Waterloo there
is in these words&mdash;the swan-song of Pitt. It was too much
for him. He fainted before Wellesley left the room. On
the 18th he rallied for a time, and the doctors saw a gleam of
hope.<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a></p>

<p>In reality there was only one faint chance of recovery, that good
news might arrive. The chief cause of physical collapse was
the torture of the brain; and it was possible that the whole
system might even now rally under the vitalizing thrills of hope.
But as day by day passed by and brought nearer that dreaded
occasion, the opening of Parliament on 22nd January, this last
chance vanished. The news which reached the Foreign Office
became more and more gloomy. On 10th January Mulgrave decided,
when recalling Harrowby, to entrust his mission at Berlin
to the Earl of Harrington, in the hope that that Court would
keep troth.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> But all negotiation was useless. By the 19th the
conduct of Prussia respecting Hanover appeared so threatening
that Ministers ordered the immediate recall of the whole
British force.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> Thus, England had sent forth some 60,000 troops
in order to bring them back again. She had paid a million sterling
to Austria, and the results were Ulm and Austerlitz.
Nearly as much had gone to Russia, and the outcome was the
armistice. A British subsidy had been claimed by Prussia, and
in return she was about to take Hanover as a gift from Napoleon.
It is to be hoped that Ministers kept the last bitter truth from
Pitt; but from their silence he must have augured the worst.
Surely death itself was better than to be driven from power by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>the combined attacks of Fox, Grenville, and Windham, the success
of which was now assured.</p>

<p>A touching instance of Pitt's thoughtfulness during these
days of waning strength is recorded by Robert Plumer Ward.
He had accepted office as Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs;
but, in the event of the overthrow of the Ministry, he would be
in a far worse position than before. Pitt remembered this fact,
and whispered to Farquhar the words "Robert Ward." He also
made signs for paper and ink and sought to pen a request for a
pension; but he succeeded only in tracing strokes which could
not be deciphered.<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> His thoughts were also with his nieces,
especially Lady Hester Stanhope. Farquhar sought to prevent a
parting interview with her; but during his temporary absence
she slipped into the bedroom, there to receive the blessing of
her uncle and an affectionate farewell. To her brother James,
who then came in, he said; "Dear soul, I know she loves me.
Where is Hester? Is Hester gone?" Early on the 22nd he dictated
these words to the bishop: "I wish &pound;1,000 or &pound;1,500 a
year to be given to my nieces if the public should think my long
services deserving it; but I do not presume to think I have
earned it."<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> He then named those to whom since 1801 he owed
sums of money: Long, Steele, Lords Camden and Carrington,
the Bishop of Lincoln and Joseph Smith; he also entrusted
his papers to the bishop and to Lord Chatham.</p>

<p>Already Bishop Tomline had warned him of his approaching
change and besought him to prepare his mind for the Sacrament.
This he declined, alleging his unworthiness to receive it.
Thereupon the bishop prayed with him. He calmly murmured
the responses and humbly confessed that he had too much
neglected prayer. Nevertheless, he affirmed the steadiness of his
religious faith and principles, and declared that he had ever
sought to fulfil his duty to God and to mankind, though with
many errors and failures. While the bishop was overcome with
emotion, the dying man thanked him earnestly for all his kindness
throughout life. Once his thoughts recurred to his own
conduct; he expressed heartfelt satisfaction at the innocency
of his life, and declared that he died in perfect charity with all
mankind.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span></p>
<p>He lingered on to the early hours of 23rd January, the twenty-fifth
anniversary of his entry into Parliament. During that night
the cares of state once more pressed upon him. He spoke often
about a private letter from Lord Harrowby, probably the
pathetic effusion quoted above. At times he asked his nephew
the direction of the wind, and on hearing it was in the east
he murmured: "East&mdash;ah that will do: that will bring him
quick."<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> Then he fell into conversation with a messenger, or,
again, he murmured "Hear, hear," until sleep enfolded him. The
last thoughts of Napoleon are said to have centred in his early
love and his army&mdash;"Jos&eacute;phine:&mdash;T&ecirc;te d'arm&eacute;e" he gasped as
he neared his end. In Pitt's being there was but one master
passion; and to it his wandering fancies returned during a last
brief spell of consciousness. As James Stanhope listened to the
breathing, there fell on his ears with a strange clearness the
words: "My country! How I leave my country!" Then the
sufferer fell once more into a deep sleep; and so he lay, until,
some three hours before the dawn, his spirit passed away in a
long-drawn sigh.</p>

</p>


<p>This noble epitaph to the memory of Pitt conveys an impression
alike of heroic endeavour and of irretrievable
failure. It is the Funeral March of Chopin, not of Handel, and it
echoes the feeling of the time. An impenetrable darkness hung
over England. Ulm, Austerlitz, the armistice, and the desertion
of the Allies by Prussia were successive waves of calamity,
which obliterated all landmarks and all means of safety. The
dying words of Pitt found response in every breast, with this
difference, that, while he was proudly conscious of the correctness
of his aims, the many, who judge solely by tangible
results, imputed to him the disasters of the war and the collapse
of the Coalition. Even Auckland exclaimed that the continental
alliances had been wretchedly mismanaged, a remark which
Malmesbury treated with quiet contempt. Grenville, who was
about to move a vote of censure on the Ministry, burst into an
agony of tears on hearing that Pitt was at death's door. His
distress of mind probably arose from a belated perception of the
factiousness of his own conduct and from grief at the unrelieved
gloom of the end of a career whose meridian splendour had
shed lustre upon him.</p>

<p>The House of Commons did not whole-heartedly accord to
the deceased statesman a burial in Westminster Abbey in the
tomb of Chatham. A motion to that effect, moved by Lascelles
and seconded by the Marquis of Titchfield, was strongly opposed
by Fox, George Ponsonby, Windham, and three other speakers.
It passed by 258 votes to 59. Still more painful was the discussion
in the Common Council of the City of London, where a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
proposal to erect a monument to Pitt was carried only by 77
votes to 71. It is safe to say that, if the fortune of war had
gone against France at Ulm and Austerlitz, Pitt would have
been ecstatically hailed as the saviour of Europe, as indeed he
was at the Guildhall after Trafalgar. How long was it before it
dawned on Auckland, Windham, and the seventy-one councillors
of the City of London, that the censures cast on the memory
of Pitt ought to have been levelled at the defender of Ulm,
the Czar Alexander and his equally presumptuous advisers at
Austerlitz, and most of all at the cringing politicians of Berlin?</p>

<p>It is now abundantly clear that Pitt fell a victim to his confidence
in the rulers of three great monarchies, whose means
were vast, whose promises were lofty, and whose surrender after
the first reverses baffled all forecasts. The descendants of Maria
Theresa and Catharine tamely retired from the fray after a single
adverse blow; and the successor of the great Frederick sheathed
his sword after the unpardonable insult at Anspach.</p>

<p>In truth, the career of Pitt came to a climax at a time of unexampled
decadence of the ancient dynasties. The destinies of
the allied Houses of Bourbon rested upon Louis&nbsp;XVI of France
and Charles&nbsp;IV of Spain. To the ineptitude of the former the
French Revolution was in large measure due. To the weakness
and falsity of the latter we may ascribe the desertion of the
royalist cause by Spain in 1795&ndash;6, with the train of disastrous
results in the Mediterranean and the West Indies. In Central
Europe Francis of Austria was scarcely more than a tool in the
hands of those subtle schemers, Thugut and Cobenzl. The
boundless resources of Russia were at the disposal of Paul and
Alexander, who, with all their generous impulses, were incapable
of steadily applying them to one definite end. Only after
weary years of subservience to Napoleon did Alexander develop
that firmness of character which finally brought salvation to the
Continent. From Frederick William even deeper humiliations
failed to evoke any heroic resolve. Among the statesmen of those
three monarchies at the time of Pitt there is but one who was a
fit compeer to him; and the fates willed that Stein should not
control affairs until the year 1807. The age of Pitt was the age
of Godoy, Thugut, and Haugwitz&mdash;weavers of old-world
schemes of partition or barter, and blind to the storm gathering
in the West.</p>

<p>The importance of his achievements in curbing their ambitions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
and saving the smaller States has not received due
recognition. He did much to rescue the Dutch Netherlands
from anarchy, and Sweden and Turkey from the clutches of
powerful neighbours. He failed, indeed, in his diplomatic
contest with Catharine; but the duplicity of the Court of Berlin,
and the factious opposition of the Whigs, made success impossible;
and he had thereafter to look on helplessly at the final
Partitions of Poland. Only those who have probed the policy of
Russia, Austria, and Prussia in the years 1787&ndash;92 can fully
realize the difficulties which attended his efforts to frame a solid
league against Revolutionary France. As well might one
attempt out of rubble to build a cannon-proof rampart.</p>

<p>At home Pitt had to deal with George&nbsp;III. Now, even under a
limited monarchy the fortunes of a statesman depend largely on
the character of his Sovereign. While possessing the initiative
which proffers timely advice, it should be under the control of
unfailing tact. Dowered with insight into character and foresight
as to the trend of events, the Monarch must, for the most
part, subordinate energy to self-repression and the prophetic
instinct to the warnings of courtly sagacity. Yet the ideal
British ruler must at times assert his will, albeit indirectly, and
with the personal charm which ensures the smooth working of
this delicately poised machine. He should therefore be the embodiment
of all the political virtues. Will even the admirers of
George claim that he realized that ideal? However excellent as
Elector of Hanover, he was a doubtful blessing as King of Great
Britain and Ireland.</p>

<p>In truth, the Hanoverian strain in his nature had not been
toned to the degree of fineness needful for the kingly office
in these islands. In a time of peculiar difficulty he sought to
govern almost absolutely by means which ensured the temporary
subservience of Parliament, and in a spirit which brought
disruption upon the Empire. The former half of Pitt's career
was largely occupied in repairing the financial waste consequent
on the American War, or in making good long arrears of legislation.
Here, indeed, is his most abiding contribution to the
national welfare. But his indebtedness to the King on questions
of foreign and domestic policy is rarely apparent. Reform,
whether Economical or Parliamentary, encountered the more or
less declared opposition of the Sovereign. On the other hand,
George showed marked ability in the support of corporate interests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
and the management of men; so that his relations to Pitt
were not unlike those of the Duke of Newcastle to Chatham.
The Pitts supplied the brain power while the Monarch or the
Duke by the award of favours ensured the needful degree of
subservience at the polls or in the lobbies of St. Stephens.</p>

<p>After the "surrender" at the close of the American War, the
attitude of George towards his British subjects was one of
scarcely concealed scorn. Now and again his feelings burst
forth uncontrollably. Shortly before his second attack of lunacy,
which occurred near the end of the fortieth year of his reign, he
astonished the congregation in church by repeating in loud and
emphatic tones the response: "Forty years long was I grieved
with this generation and said: 'It is a people that do err in
their hearts, for they have not known My ways.'" The tones of
the voice betokened the approach of lunacy, but the conviction
of the mind was always the same. For the most part, however,
scorn was tempered by calculation. His letters to Pitt are full of
commendation of the House of Commons when it unquestioningly
passed Government Bills or the Supplies; whereas he
looked on Fox and Burke as baneful and wearisome talkers,
consumers of time, and foes to healthful slumber. Similarly, in
his political catechism, the whole duty of Parliament was to help
Ministers to govern; while their proper function was to raise the
maximum of revenue with the minimum of fuss and change. In
short, to maintain the existing social order; to allow no change
in a constitution which aroused the wonder or envy of other
nations; to use peerages and bishoprics, pocket boroughs and
sinecures, as a means of buttressing that fabric, such were the
aims of the third George.</p>

<p>Failing materially to weaken the force of this mighty engine of
patronage, Pitt was fain to make the best of things as they were.
The defeat of his Reform Bill in 1785 was the chief crisis in
his early career; for it involved the failure of the Abolition Bill,
perhaps also of the schemes for the relief of the poor which he
outlined in 1797. In fact, after the year 1785, and still more so
after 1790, he had to govern mainly as King's Minister, not as
the people's Minister. Worst of all, the centre of political gravity
remained dangerously high throughout the storms of the Revolutionary
Era. How much of the nation's energy then went forth
in justifiable discontent and futile efforts at repression has already
appeared. Up to the year 1798 the struggle against France was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
largely one of the governing class against a nation; and for this
the King and the British oligarchy, not Pitt, were responsible.
Personal charm and the magnetic gift of evoking enthusiasm
have in some monarchs counterbalanced defects of narrowness
and intolerance. George was not deficient in courtly grace and
tact&mdash;witness his remark to Pitt at their first interview after the
long separation of the years 1801&ndash;1804. When Pitt ventured
to compliment the King on his looking better than after the
illness of 1801, the latter at once replied: "That is not to be
wondered at: I was then on the point of parting with an old
friend. Now I am about to regain one." But these gracious
remarks came rarely in his closing years, which were marked by
increasing harshness to his family, petulance on the most trivial
affairs, and an outlook more narrowly personal than ever.</p>

<p>Such a nature chafes its surroundings. It arouses no enthusiasm;
it merely begets heat by friction. Pitt has been blamed
for spending too much time and energy in speeches about the war.
But there was no other way of kindling the nation's zeal. The
Princes very rarely spoke in the House of Lords, except under
an overmastering fear of the abolition of the Slave Trade. None
of the Ministers, except Windham, had the gift of oratory. On
Pitt alone devolved the task of arousing a national spirit; and a
cruel destiny cut short his life at the very time when his inspiring
presence was most needed. How much England then lost
can never be known. Vorontzoff, Russian ambassador at London,
who had earlier been a bitter enemy of Pitt, now expressed the
fervent desire that death had carried off his weary old frame,
rather than that of the potential Saviour of Europe. The words
are instinct with prescience. The personality and the actions of
Pitt were alike a summons to a life of dignity and manly independence.
His successors had perforce to take a course not
unlike that which they were about to censure in him; and the distrust
which the Czar Alexander felt for them in part accounts
for the collapse at Tilsit and the ensuing years of bondage to
Napoleon.</p>

<p>The disintegrating effects of the party system, or rather of its
factious use by the Whig leaders, have been explained in these
pages. Its first result was seen in the divergence of the careers
of Pitt and Fox. The cause of Reform ought to have received
their undivided support; but little by little they were edged
apart, and their hostility was perhaps the most lasting of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
many evils wrought by the unnatural Coalition of Fox and North.
For a time Pitt gathered around him a national party, which
became avowedly so on the junction of the Old Whigs in 1794.
But in the last years of his life the denuding influences of partisan
and personal feuds disastrously thinned his following. From the
refusal of George to grant Catholic Emancipation, and the consequent
resignation of Pitt in the spring of 1801, we may trace
three sinister results. The Union with Ireland was bereft of its
natural sequel, Catholic Emancipation; the Ministerial ranks
were cleft in twain; and the crisis brought to the front Addington,
a man utterly incapable of confronting Napoleon. Had Pitt
remained in power, the Peace of Amiens would have been less
one-sided, its maintenance more dignified; and the First Consul,
who respected the strong but bullied the weak, would probably
have acquiesced in a settlement consonant with the reviving
prestige of England. But though the Union Jack won notable
triumphs in the spring of 1801, yet at London everything went
awry. Moved by consideration for the King, then recovering
from lunacy, Pitt weakly promised not to bring forward Catholic
Emancipation during his life, an act which annoyed the Grenville&ndash;Windham
group. His rash promise to support Addington tied
his hands in the following years; and even after the renewal
of war he too scrupulously refrained from overthrowing a
Ministry whose weakness had invited foreign aggressions and
was powerless to avenge them. Finally, the Grenvilles joined
Fox; and thus the King's perversity nullified the efforts of Pitt
to form an Administration worthy to cope with Napoleon.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the challenge flung down to England by the
French regicides in 1793 was such as to enhance the person of the
Monarch in these islands; and the Revolutionary War, which
was fatal to several dynasties on the Continent, served to consolidate
the power of the House of Brunswick. For, though
Pitt sought to keep the war from becoming a royalist crusade,
it almost inevitably assumed that character. During hostilities
there can be but two sharply defined parties. Accordingly,
Pitt, who opened his career with a bold attack upon the prerogatives
of George&nbsp;III, ended it as his champion, even consenting
to surrender a cherished conviction in order that the
Monarch's peace of mind might not be troubled. Was ever a
Minister beset by more baffling problems, by more hampering
restrictions? Peace might have solved and shattered them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
But peace he could not secure in the years 1796, 1797; and
when finally it came it proved to be no peace, merely a pause
before a still greater cycle of war.</p>

<p>The grandeur of Pitt's efforts for ensuring the independence
of Europe has somewhat obscured his services as Empire builder.
Yet, with the possible exception of Chatham, no statesman has
exercised a greater influence on the destinies of the British race.
On two occasions he sternly set his face against the cession of
Gibraltar; he took keen interest in the settlement of New South
Wales; his arrangements for the government of Canada deserve
far higher praise than they have usually secured; and his firmness
in repelling the archaic claims of Spain to the shores of the
Northern Pacific gained for his people the future colony of
British Columbia. Cherishing a belief in the pacific nature of
Bonaparte's policy at the time of the Treaty of Amiens, he condoned
the retrocession of the Cape of Good Hope and of Malta,
on condition of the gain of Ceylon and Trinidad; but after the
revival of French schemes of aggression in the East he saw the
imperative need of planting or maintaining the Union Jack at
those commanding points. He, who has been accused of excessive
trust in allies, prepared to forego the alliance of Russia
rather than give up Malta; and, even before Nelson gained the
mastery at sea, Pitt sent forth an expedition to conquer the
Cape. In his magnanimous desire of securing to Europe the
blessings of a lasting peace he was ready to surrender maritime
conquests of greater pecuniary value so long as England held
the keys of the overland and sea routes to India. To that
empire his just and statesmanlike policy brought a new sense of
confidence and therefore a time of comparative rest, until the
threatening orientation of Bonaparte's plans once more placed
everything at hazard. Thanks to the exertions of Dundas and
the Wellesleys, the crisis was averted; but the policy which
assured British supremacy in the East was essentially that of
Pitt.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is far easier to assess the importance of the life work of Pitt
than to set forth his character in living traits. Those who knew
him well agree as the charm of his personality; but they supply
few illuminating details, perhaps out of respect for the reserve
which was his usual panoply. Like Chatham he rarely revealed
his inmost self. The beauties of his conversation, informed with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
learning, sparkling with wit, always vivacious yet never spiteful,
never appeared in their full glow except in the circle of his
dearest friends; but by singular ill fortune they who could have
handed on those treasures, were satisfied with entries such as:
"Pitt talked a great deal among his friends"; or, "In society
he was remarkably cheerful and pleasant, full of wit and playfulness";<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a>
or again, "His great delight was society. There he
shone with a degree of calm and steady lustre which often
astonished me more than his most splendid efforts in Parliament;
... he seemed utterly unconscious of his own superiority
and much more disposed to listen than to talk;&nbsp;... his
appearance dispelled all care, his brow was never clouded even
in the severest public trials."<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> These are only the <span lang="fr">hors d'&#0339;uvres</span>
of what must have been a feast of delight; but even they
suffice to refute the Whig slanders as to Pitt's austerity and
selfishness. Under happier auspices he would have been known
as the most lovable of English statesmen; and his exceptional
fondness for children would alone suffice to expose the falsity of
his alleged reply to a manufacturer who complained that he
could not get enough men&mdash;"Then you must take the children."<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a>
Cynicism at the expense of the weak was a trait utterly alien to
him. It is also incorrect to assert, with Macaulay, that "pride pervaded
the whole man, was written in the harsh rigid lines of his
face, was marked by the way in which he walked, in which he
sat, in which he stood, and, above all, in which he bowed." The
Whig historian, here following the Whig tradition, formed his
estimate of the whole man from what was merely a parliamentary
mannerism. Pitt, as we have seen, was a prey to shyness
and <span lang="fr">gaucherie</span>; and the rigid attitude which he adopted for
the House was not so much the outcome of a sense of superiority
(though he had an able man's consciousness of worth) as a
screen to hide those defects. A curiously stilted manner has been
the bane of many gifted orators and actors; but the real test is
whether they could throw it off in private. That Pitt threw it off
in the circle of his friends they all agree. The only defects
which Wilberforce saw in him were an inadequate knowledge of
human nature, a too sanguine estimate of men and of the course
of events, and, in later years, occasional displays of petulance in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>face of opposition.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> The first are the defects of a noble nature,
the last those of a man whose strength has long been overtaxed.</p>

<p>In fact, Pitt's constitution was unequal to the prolonged strain.
In childhood his astonishingly precocious powers needed judicious
repression. Instead, they were unduly forced by the paternal
pride of Chatham. At Cambridge, at Lincoln's Inn, and in
Parliament the intellectual pressure was maintained, with the
result that his weakly frame was constantly overwrought and
attenuated by a too active mind. Further, the pressure at Westminster
was so continuous as to preclude all chance of widening
his nature by foreign travel. He caught but a glimpse of the
life of France in 1783; and his knowledge of other peoples and
politics was therefore perforce derived from books. It is therefore
surprising that the young Prime Minister displayed the
sagacity and tolerance which marked his career.</p>

<p>But his faculties, though not transcendently great, were
singularly well balanced, besides being controlled by an indomitable
will and tact that rarely was at fault. In oratory he
did not equal Sheridan in wit and brilliance, Burke in richness
of thought and majesty of diction, or Fox in massive strength
and debating facility; but, while falling little short of Fox in
debate, he excelled him in elegance and conciseness, Burke in
point and common sense, Sheridan in dignity and argumentative
power, and all of them in the felicitous wedding of elevated
thought or vigorous argument to noble diction. By the side of his
serried yet persuasive periods the efforts of Fox seemed ragged,
those of Burke philosophic essays, those of Sheridan rhetorical
tinsel. And this harmony was not the effect of long and
painful training. His maiden speech of 26th February 1781
displayed the grace and forcefulness which marked his classic
utterance at the Lord Mayor's banquet ten weeks before his
death.</p>

<p>Precocious maturity also characterized his financial plans,
which displayed alike the shrewd common sense of those of
Walpole and the wider aims of Adam Smith. Before his twenty-sixth
year Pitt laid the basis of a system which, whatever its
defects, ensured the speedy recovery of national credit and
belied the spiteful croakings of foreign rivals. Four days after
his death, Fox freely admitted that the establishment of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>Sinking Fund had been most beneficial; and this belief, though
we now see it to be ill-founded, certainly endowed the nation
with courage to continue the struggle against the overgrown
power of France. Scarcely less remarkable is his record of
legislative achievement. His India Bill of 1784, his attempt to
free Anglo-Irish trade from antiquated shackles, his effort to
present to Parliament a palatable yet not ineffective scheme of
Reform, raise him above the other law-givers of the eighteenth
century in the grandeur of his aims if not in his actual achievements.
By the India Bill of 1784 he reconciled the almost
incompatible claims of eastern autocracy and western democracy.
If he failed to carry fiscal and Parliamentary Reform, it was
due less to tactical defects on his part than to prejudice and
selfishness among those whom he sought to benefit.</p>

<p>On the other hand, his intense hopefulness often led him
to overlook obstacles and to credit all men with his own high
standard of intelligence and probity, a noble defect which not
seldom marred his diplomatic and military arrangements during
the Great War. At no point have I slurred over his mistakes,
his diffusion of effort over too large an area of conflict, and his
perhaps undue trust in doubtful allies. But, even so, as I have
shown, a careful examination of all the available evidence
generally reveals the reasons for his confidence; and failures
due to this cause are far less disastrous, because less dispiriting
to the nation, than those which are the outcome of sluggishness
or cowardice. Of those unpardonable sins Pitt has never been
accused even by his severest critics. After the repulse of his
pacific overtures by the French Directory in September 1797
his attitude was one almost of defiance, witness his curt rejection
of similar offers by Bonaparte early in 1800, which may be pronounced
the gravest defect of his diplomatic career.</p>

<p>In that age the action of statesmen was often dilatory; and
we must admit that in regard to the Act of Union with Ireland
Pitt's procedure was halting and ineffective, so that finally he
was driven to use corrupt means to force through the corrupt
Irish Parliament a measure which in the autumn of 1798 would
have been accepted thankfully by the dominant caste. His
Bill of 1797 for the relief of the poor and his Land Tax Commutation
Act of 1798 are examples of improvident legislation.
But from a leader overburdened with the details of war and
diplomacy we should not expect the keen foresight, the minute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
care as to details, which distinguished Gladstone. To compare
the achievements of a statesman hard pressed by the problems
of the Revolutionary Era with those of a peaceful age when the
standard of legislative effort had been greatly raised is unfair;
and the criticism of Pitt by a distinguished historian evinces
partiality towards the Victorian statesman rather than an adequate
appreciation of the difficulties besetting a Minister of
George&nbsp;III in those times of turmoil.<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> It is true that Pitt did
not inaugurate Factory legislation; that was the work of the
Addington Cabinet in 1802; he did not link his name with the
efforts of Romilly and others for the reform of the brutal Penal
Code; and he did little for art and literature; but neither the
personality of George nor the state of the national finances
favoured the rise of a Maecenas.</p>

<p>Concentration of effort on political and diplomatic questions
was the alpha and omega of Pitt's creed. The terrible pressure
of events forbade his looking far ahead or far afield; he marched
straight onward, hoping by his untiring efforts first to restore
national prosperity and thereafter to secure a peace which would
inaugurate a brighter future. His overtaxed strength collapsed
when the strain was most tense; and his life therefore figures as
a torso, which should not be criticized as if it were the perfect
statue. Yet, as moral grandeur is always inspiring, Pitt's efforts
were finally to be crowned with success by the statesmen who
had found wisdom in his teaching, inspiration in his quenchless
hope, enthusiasm in his all-absorbing love of country. An
egoist never founds a school of the prophets. But Pitt, who</p>


<p class="poem">
Spurn'd at the sordid lust of pelf<br />
And served his Albion for herself,<br />
</p>


<p>trained and inspired a band of devoted disciples such as no
other leader of the eighteenth century left behind him. Some
were unimaginative plodders, as Perceval; others were capable
administrators and shrewd diplomatists, as Castlereagh; to one
alone was vouchsafed the fire of genius, the sympathetic insight,
the soaring ambition held in check by overmastering
patriotism, which were commingled in the personality of the
master; and Canning afterwards declared that he buried his
political allegiance in the grave of Pitt. It was granted to these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>men to labour on in the cause for which he gave his life, and
finally, in the years 1814&ndash;15, to bring back France to her old
frontiers by arrangements which he clearly outlined in the years
1798 and 1805. Of the numerous annexations and changes of
boundaries effected by Napoleon, only one, the Valtelline, was
destined to survive. But Europe after Waterloo testified alike
to the sagacity and the limitations of the mind of William Pitt.</p>

Mr. Bain must refer to the charges (invented at St Petersburg)
that Pitt had egged Gustavus on to war against Russia, and then deserted
him. In the former volume (chapters xxi-iii) I proved the falsity of those
charges. It would be more correct to say that Gustavus deserted England.</p></div>

the French Rev.," 253) accepted the stories against Pitt. He states that
Danton secretly offered to save Louis for &pound;40,000; that Lansdowne,
Sheridan, and Fox urged Pitt to interpose; and that Pitt informed Maret that
he did not do so because the execution of Louis would ruin the Whigs. I
must reply that Lord Fitzmaurice assures me there is no sign that the first
Lord Lansdowne urged Pitt to bribe the Convention, though in the debate
of 21st December 1792 he suggested the sending an ambassador to Paris to
improve the relations of the two lands, and assuage the hostility to Louis.
Further, Danton could scarcely have made that offer; for he left Paris for
Belgium on 1st December, and did not return till 14th January, after which
he was engrossed in the last illness of his wife. Danton's name was dragged
into the affair probably by mistake for Dannon (see Belloc, "Danton,"
200). Lastly, as Maret left London on 19th December, and did not return
until 30th January, he did not see Pitt at the crucial time of the trial. And
would Pitt have made so damaging a remark to a Frenchman? Is it not
obviously a Whig slander?</p></div>

Ireland, asking him to send the flank companies (the best men) of the
regiments then in Ireland. Westmorland agreed on 18th September, but
said they could not sail in less than three weeks. As the crisis at Toulon
deepened, Pitt, about the middle of November, begged the Lord Lieutenant
to send the 35th, 41st, and 42nd regiments from Ireland to Toulon. On
20th November Westmorland agreed (though pointing out the danger of an
Irish rising). On the 30th he said the two latter regiments were ready to sail
from Cork whenever the transports should arrive; but the delays in the
arrival and sailing of transports had always been serious&mdash;a prophetic

of paper notes by banks having limited resources. Their stoppage
affected larger Houses and paralysed trade. He had wanted to meet the
City men, who met on the 22nd to discuss the situation, but failed to agree on
any remedy. Finally they agreed to meet at the Mansion House to discuss
the issue of Exchequer Bills. Coutts, on 19th March 1797, informed Pitt
that gambling in the Prince of Wales' Debentures, which exceeded &pound;432,000,
ruined the market for ordinary securities (Pitt MSS., 126). Sinclair had

On 24th May 1798 Thelwall wrote to Thos. Hardy from Llyswen, near
Brecknock, describing his rustic retreat, and requesting a new pair of
farmer's boots for "Stella." He hopes that O'Connor has returned in
triumph to his friends. Tierney's vote in favour of suspending the Habeas
Corpus Act does not surprise him, for he is vulgar and a sycophant. Hardy
is too angry with Sheridan, whose chief offence is in going at all to the
House of Commons. Sheridan surely does well in encouraging the people
to resist an invasion. "I remain steady to my point&mdash;'no nation can be
free but by its own efforts.' As for the French Directory and its faction,
nothing appears to me to be further from their design than to leave one
atom of liberty either to their own or to any nation. If, however, Mr.
Sheridan supposes that all his talents can produce even a temporary
unanimity while the present crew are in power, even for repelling the
most inveterate enemy, he will find himself miserably mistaken. No such
unanimity ever can exist: I am convinced, nay, the Ministers themselves
seem determined, that it <em>shall</em> not. The only way to produce the unanimity
desired is to stand aloof, and let these ruffians go blundering on till our
most blessed and gracious sovereign shall see that either Pitt and Co. must
bow down to the will of the people or his British crown bow down to five
French shillings.... But what have we to do with Directories or politics?
Peaceful shades of Llyswen! shelter me beneath your luxuriant foliage:
lull me to forgetfulness, ye murmuring waters of the Wye. Let me be part
farmer and fisherman. But no more politics&mdash;no more politics in this bad
world!" (From Mr. A. M. Broadley's MSS.)</p></div>

to Middleton (probably of February 1805) asking him to consider "whether
it might not be expedient to direct Sir John Warren to proceed to Cape de
Verde, and if he there found that Sir James Duckworth was gone to the
West Indies, but not upon certain information of the enemy having preceded
him, that Sir J. Warren should be ordered on to the Cape, unless he
received intelligence that the enemy had taken another course." He adds
that this suggestion arises out of the news received from the Cape, where
French troops were expected. In that case the operations would be protracted.
Pitt hoped that Warren would be back in five months, that is by
1st June, before which time the French preparations for the invasion of
England would not be far advanced. Evidently, then, Pitt sought Middleton's
advice direct on the complex problem of defending England and
guarding the overland and the sea routes to India at the same time. On
this see Corbett, "Trafalgar Campaign," 236&ndash;8.</p></div>
